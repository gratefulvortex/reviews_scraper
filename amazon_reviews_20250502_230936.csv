951f08cc3531b86c0c729eb9f183bd53,,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 20 November 2018,"Winters are here and so is the season of dry skin and chapped lips.

Moisturising your skin is most essential during winters to prevent ageing and uneven skin tones. It also keeps you fresh all day and increases your work capacity.

Oily creams and moisturisers may be unacceptable to some and may cause breakouts in some others. I have acne problem and so I remain very careful in what I apply on my skin.

While searching for a good skin care routine product, I came across this aloe gel formula from Indus Valley. I ordered it because the packaging was vintage ( I love vintagggeeee).

The biggest advantages about this product:
* easy to incorporate in your day to day skin care. If you have to apply the original aloe from the leaves, it will take some time to cut, wash, peel the leaves. It might not be the best idea for your busy schedule.
* It is not oily at all
* Made from natural product. Does not contain any chemicals or toxic substances
* Has a very nice aroma.

I am presenting to you some of the ways, I love to use aloe gel in my day to day routine. Hope you like it too.

Aloe gel has Vitamin E which acts as an antioxidant and a natural nutrient for your skin.

* Over the night moisturiser: Apply a teaspoonful of gel on your face and massage thoroughly. Leave it overnight to get a soft skin in the morning.
* Morning moisturiser: After washing your face, use aloe gel to soothe your skin and before going out. This protects the delicate skin from the harsh sunrays, pollution and dry air.
* Body lotion: You can use it to apply on your hands and legs in general as a good moisturiser.
* Hair mask: Mix it with a little amount of curd and prepare a paste. Apply it on your hair from roots to tips. Leave it for 1 hour and then wash it usually. This conditions and strengthens your hair. Alternately you can also apply the raw aloe gel to avail the same benefits. Do this once every 2 weeks.

So these are some of the ways, I like to use Aloe gel in my routine. If you guys have some novel ways, do let me know. I would love to try that.

And thats the end of it! Hope you enjoyed it! Send me feedback regarding what you would love to see on my blog next‚ù§Ô∏è

Since it was lockdown phase I wanted to get it asap for her so that she can get relief. And after searching and going through all the reviews I ordered this product.
And it‚Äôs been more than two weeks she is using this aloe Vera gel and trust me it‚Äôs very good.
The fragrance is amazing, it really gives skin a smooth texture, and also makes the skin fresh. Since I ordered this for the skin problem it actually gave relief in the inflammation and itching problem on the blisters.
Last but not the least Being a prime member I got this delivered at my door step the very next day as promised.
Gonna buy it again.",True,One person found this helpful

This Aloe Vera gel by @indusvalley_brand smells like rose water and works great on skin and hair. Just apply it whenever you feel like applying an moisturizer, however, for maximum benefits apply it at night.
You can use it to massage your hair before hairwash as well. .

Though Aloe Vera is easily available and can be applied on the raw form as well but this gel by @indusvalley_brand is mixed with rose water, wheatgerm and honey and add more benefits to it. .
I've been using it since week and can say that it works great as a daily moisturizer and even better as a night cream!

It has a mild fragnance which leaves a pleasant feeling ( if there is no scent It would be great) it leaves ur skin feeling supple if used immediately after washing ur face . So even people with sensitive skin can safely use it ( as I am one among them).,True,0 people found this helpful
