,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2021","I bought this 2020 MacBook Air (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage) to replace a 2014 MacBook Air (4GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage). I am undeniably a fan of Apple products in general, because they work with little fuss and are built to last (note that my old MacBook Air is more than 7 years old and still working perfectly). Although I've been underwhelmed by some Mac models in recent years, this one is stellar IMHO. Unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice.

The M1 processor is very impressive, delivering outstanding performance and power/thermal efficiency simultaneously. Battery life is every bit as good as advertised; I can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in. Connecting USB devices such as external drives will shorten battery life, but that's to be expected. I love the fanless design, which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times, while the thermal efficiency of the M1 chip allows it to remain amazingly cool. In use, this computer feels very fast, especially with apps optimized for Apple processors (as MacOS Big Sur is). Interestingly, Microsoft has been on board early with M1 optimization; the latest Office 365 version is smooth and fast on this machine. I also tried out MS Edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that it's my current default browser. The touch ID and Apple Pay capability is a welcome addition.

The only cons I see are minor in my opinion. Because RAM is integrated into the M1 processor, post-purchase memory expansion is not possible; if you think you'll need 16 GB of memory that model can be had from the Apple Store. There has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports, which is fair. For me that's not insurmountable; I simply use a USB-C hub to provide additional connectivity. I've read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their M1 Macs, which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs. To be on the safe side I use a built-in port for charging and have had no issues.

Reading through the relative handful of critical reviews, it looks to me like most (excluding actual defects, which happen with all products) are based on lack of understanding. For example, I saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine ""has NO USB PORTS!!!"", which is patently false. In fact, its two ports are both USB, they just require a different connector. What these users are looking for is the old USB-A connectors, which this MacBook does not have; however, that's easily fixed by using a USB-A to USB-C converter cable, or with a USB-C hub. USB-A peripherals are gradually disappearing as well, in favor of the new connector.

All things considered, I really love this machine. The $899 price (at the time I bought mine) was $100 less than I would have paid at the Apple Store, and I believe I can probably get $200 on eBay for my old MacBook Air (try that with a 7-year-old PC!) leaving me with a total outlay of $699. Considering that I'll almost certainly get 5 or more years use out of this model, I'm very happy with my purchase and would do it again.",True,72 people found this helpful
,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2020","I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.

Good:

- SCREEN looks great! 2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel. I usually don't go above 50% brightness.

- KEYBOARD is good. Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard. Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.

- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic. Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great. Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.

- LOOKS GREAT. Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great. Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.

- NO FAN. That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap. Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.

- PERFORMANCE. It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time. For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast. Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU. Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.

- TOUCH ID is great still. Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons. On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.

- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA. Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch). You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay. And so on and so forth.

- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.

NOT GOOD:

- WEBCAM still sucks. Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc. Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).

- ONLY 2 PORTS. Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort). Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame. I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.

- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.

- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery. Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.

OVERALL:

A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem. Love it so far!",True,470 people found this helpful
,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2022","I recently migrated to Apple after many years using a wide variety of PCs running Windows or Linux. I decided to make that move after Apple's introduction of the M1 processor, which has been proven to be an excellent hardware platform. Now. of course, the M2 has been released, but, depending on your needs, the 2020 Macbook Air with the M1 will save you some money while still delivering outstanding performance and some of the most attractively and perfectly manufactured hardware. You can search the Internet for professional reviews of the Macbook Air, but I feel confident you'll find plenty to verify what I'm saying.

The Retina display is beautiful. The sound system is superior to any other laptop I have owned or used. The battery holds up all day under typical use, and I can verify that the battery holds its charge well for at least a week while the notebook is powered off. The Apple OS (Monterey) is smooth and fast, and I was able to learn my way around in it quickly. When you need help, a Google search will yield tons of tips quickly, or you can avail yourself of Apple support.

I will say that the Air is a little short on USB ports, lacks a built-in card slot, and, of course, is not equipped with a touchscreen. However, I have run a USB hub from one of the two Thunderbolt ports, and there seems to be enough power to support my flash drives and card readers...even a portable DVD-burner. As far as a touchscreen goes, I have that on a Dell laptop I run Linux on, but I never use it...guess I'm a mouse or touchpad guy.

The aluminum housing is beautifully machined and finished, the keyboard has a very nice touch, the battery seems to charge quickly, and the Air is light at under 3 lbs.

One last thing! I have been a heavy user of both Google and Microsoft services, and I have found that Apple provides ample support for integrating those services into the Mac environment. I run Google's Backup and Sync and Microsoft's OneDrive with no problems. My AVG subscription allows me to use my antivirus software on both Mac OS and Windows machines.

I have no regrets for this purchase. Actually, the Air was my 3rd M1 Mac. I also have an iMac and a Mac Mini. They all work together very well!",True,252 people found this helpful

,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2021","I have had the M1 MacBook Air 13-inch now since December 2020. It has served me so well and has been one of the most reliable laptops I've ever owned. I am originally a PC guy and now work back and forth between Windows OS and Mac OS.

When it comes to rendering videos and clips, this does a way better job at 4K resolution compared to my former Alienware 17 inch laptop AND my workplace's gaming desktop!

I am pretty happy with the battery life so far. I have been getting 10+ hours of hard real-world usage. I bring a nice USB-C portable battery with me to charge it when I am doing work on the weekends out of town or while on the plane. This thing has not failed me once.

8GB of RAM is more than enough for the majority of consumers and is enough for me even though I edit photos and videos all the time. I have not seen any ""throttling"" from the M1 MacBook Air since ownership. I can even open up 30+ tabs on Chrome without issue.

256GB storage is enough as long as you have an external storage. I highly recommend investing in getting an SSD or NVMe external storage so transfer speeds are optimal. Otherwise, as long as you are keeping the core hard drive tidy, you won't run into any storage issues.

Virtual classes are nice. The webcam quality is crystal clear, and it is noticeably better than most of my peers.

My only complaint is that the design is a bit ""outdated"" despite how premium and beautiful it is.

Just FYI. I just bought two of these; one for myself and one for my friend who just had a massive upgrade from her ""prehistoric"" 2010 iMac. She was absolutely mindblown by how much faster and better it is compared to the older iMac.

Overall, this is a very nice all-around computer laptop for ANY student from K all the way up to the graduate level. Go get this beast of a machine now for $850.",True,72 people found this helpful
,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2023","I had been a Mac user for years, but then got interested in the Microsoft Surface line, and bought the Pro 6 model a few years back. I liked it well enough, despite finding that I really didn't use the convertible capabilities of that device very often -- I found it to be too heavy to use as a proper tablet, and it also didn't function very well as a true ""laptop.""
I ""upgraded"" a few months back to the Surface Pro 9, and found it to actually be a downgrade. Main issues being: no noticeable improvements in performance or display quality, and the VERY noisy fan would be screaming almost constantly during normal usage. Also, the battery life was absolutely abysmal.
I finally got fed-up, noticed that there were great deals to be had on the M1 MacBook Air, and thought `why not?' SO glad I gave it a try! I notice absolutely no performance difference between either of the Surface models I owned, and it runs quiet -- because there is NO fan to make any noise. In my experience so far the unit does not overheat, either. And the kicker: battery life is absolutely amazing. As in: seemingly unkillable. It just goes and goes, for hours of normal usage. I love it. With the Surface, I wouldn't even consider taking anywhere to work, without a power supply. Now I wouldn't hesitate to take my MacBook and I bet I could work all day at a remote location without plugging in.
As far as being back in the Apple/Mac ecosystem: meh. I'm surprised how little MacOS has NOT changed since I lasted was a user, and also how kinda underwhelming it is. But in 2023 do different flavors of operating system really matter? Nope. Once you open a browser it simply doesn't matter. I'm getting used to hitting the ""Apple"" key again, but that's not a big deal.
Overall, very happy. The MacBook is a solid choice, and I'm glad I just got the Air over the Pro -- I have no need for the larger screen nor the premium performance, and the M1 Air is a major bargain right now.",True,22 people found this helpful

,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2025","Intro
I purchased the M1 MacBook Air in 2023, and the experience has been great, albeit with some minor bugs introduced in macOS Sonoma, which were fixed in macOS Sequoia. Fast forward to March 2024, Apple replaced the base model M1 MacBook Air with the M2 MacBook Air. This now makes it an even greater time to purchase the M1 MacBook Air, as prices have decreased, making the price of admission more accessible to a wider audience. The power and performance that you get with an M1 MacBook Air are greater than that of a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an Intel i9 processor. When that machine came out, it cost 5x the cost of the M1 MacBook Air. Let that sit in your head for a minute, and be sure to never question or doubt the power that the M1 MacBook Air possesses. As said in the slogan of the M1 MacBook Air by Apple, “Power. It’s in the Air.” That remains true in 2025, even with the release of the M3 MacBook Air. This machine is powerful enough to be used for audio, video, and photo production, and it won’t be reduced to typing documents and web browsing anytime soon.

All Macs based on the modern architecture of Apple Silicon are fully capable of doing professional work regardless of needs, and the M1 MacBook Air is no exception. If you are currently on any Intel-based machine, the improvements in performance are night and day. If you are limited on cash, you no longer have an excuse not to purchase a brand-new Mac laptop. In addition to great performance, Apple Silicon is far more efficient in power consumption than its predecessor. Because of this, we are able to get “real” all-day battery life using the same battery, in the same chassis as the previous Intel-based MacBook Air. The chassis features the iconic wedge-shaped design with no sharp edges, making this machine comfortable to type on.

Specs
The M1 MacBook Air sports what Apple calls “Magic keyboard,” which is essentially a refinement of the “proper” keyboard that Apple has used all these years before the tragedy known as the butterfly keyboard was introduced. We get a 13-inch IPS LED backlit display with a native resolution of 2560x1600, 400 nits of brightness, wide color P3 gamut, and true tone technology. This is an improvement over the previous Intel-based Retina MacBook Air released the same year, which only featured an sRGB color gamut. These improvements enable photo and video editing with more accurate color grading to be achieved on the M1 MacBook Air. The 720p webcam features an “advanced image signal processor with computational video,” which enhances video quality over its predecessor.

Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is also included in the M1 MacBook Air as opposed to Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) in its predecessor. This means multiuser support (OFDMA) with support for up to 8 AP spatial streams and a max data rate of 9.6 Gbps. 802.11ax supports these performance benefits on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. In contrast, 802.11ac supported 4 AP special streams, a max data rate of 6.9 Gbps, and was only supported on the 5 GHz band. 802.11ax includes BSS (basic service set) coloring, which adds a field to the wireless frame in order to overcome interference associated with same-frequency cell coexistence, leading to increased capacity and stability over its predecessor. 802.11ax also uses less power than its predecessor, adding to improved battery life.

The M1 chip features an 8-core CPU with 4 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores, a 7-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The notebook comes with a 49.9 watt-hour lithium-polymer battery and a 30W USB-C Power Delivery power adapter. Apple says that the battery life can last up to 15 hours when web browsing and up to 18 hours while watching Apple TV. That is an improvement over its predecessor, which provided up to 11 hours when web browsing wirelessly and up to 12 hours for Apple TV movie playback.

Touch ID offers a convenient and secure authentication method, particularly when using your MacBook Air in public spaces where you may not desire your keystrokes to be recorded by unethical individuals.

Desktop Setup
After purchasing and using this machine in a proper desk setup, there are two things I have taken note of. The included 30W charger is underpowered when the MacBook Air is used in a ""desktop"" setup with an external display and SSD attached, as the additional power is drawn from the batteries during peak usage. The M1 MacBook Air has 2 USB-C ports. If you are using a non-USB-C based monitor, you will be required to use a USB-C hub with HDMI, etc., in order to use this device in a proper desktop configuration. Apple’s Multiport USB-C AV Adapter takes 6W of power for itself, leaving a theoretical 24W for the MacBook Air. macOS’s energy management is top-notch; however, when used in this configuration, processor and graphically intensive tasks will cause the MacBook Air to pull power from the battery in addition to that being supplied by the power adapter.

The max power will be pulled initially, but after thermal throttling kicks in, the power requirements are reduced, and power is then taken exclusively from the power adapter. During the initial stage, coconutBattery shows 1-5W of power being pulled from the battery, but then this amount is gradually reduced to 0W after a few minutes. The battery loses less than 1% state-of-charge during this process according to coconutBattery; however, this negligible amount is not displayed by the built-in battery meter, which will still indicate 100% SoC.

At first, I had assumed that this would not be an issue, as I was advised by other “pros”. The M2 & M3 MacBook Air and many Windows-based notebooks conduct this same behavior out-of-the-box when pushed with their included charger connected directly to them. My mind was at rest regarding the matter until I saw my battery health degrading rapidly. After less than 5 months, macOS showed a battery health reading of 89%, and coconutBattery displayed a reading of 84%. I continued using the default charger until less than a month later when macOS displayed a battery health reading of 88%, and coconutBattery displayed a reading of 82%. I began to assume that my battery was defective and that I would have to return and replace my machine as it was less than 6 months old.

Despite all the noise from other “tech pros” in the IT industry who claim that “your Mac can manage itself” and that using the underpowered charger is a non-issue, my intuition was telling me that due to power being pulled from the battery while plugged in, the battery health meter was incorrect and needed to be re-calibrated. Thankfully, I had already owned an Anker A2613 60W Power Port Atom III Gan charger purchased on Amazon in 2019 that I used exclusively to charge my previous Non-Retina MacBook Air. That Mac along with its battery is still going strong today, albeit with the unavoidable “Service Recommended” tag that only just came on in February of 2024. I swapped out the included 30W Apple power adapter for the 60W Anker. I then used it exclusively with the M1 MacBook Air over the period of 2 weeks, discharging to 0% and back to 100% at least 2 times per week. This re-calibrated the battery’s health sensors, and sure enough, the battery health reading in coconutBattery increased, thankfully. macOS held on to its 88% battery health percentage for the greater part of 2024, while coconutBattery reported an increase to ~85.2% up from the 82% it previously displayed.

Battery Temperature
When charging from 1% SoC, battery temperatures climb to 38 ℃ when using the included 30W charger and up to ~40 ℃ with the 60W Anker charger. The max charging temperature for lithium-ion batteries is 45℃, and so this temperature is well within tolerances; macOS will automatically disable charging if temperatures reach that level. During sustained processor and graphically intense usage, the M1 MacBook Air’s battery temperature can be seen maxing out at ~45.5 ℃ until thermal throttling kicks in and consequently reducing battery temperature to ~43 ℃ while the task remains in progress. This is the “intense usage” temperature regardless of the M1 MacBook Air being used while plugged in with a full battery or while being used unplugged. The maximum discharge rate for lithium-ion batteries is 60℃, so once again this is within tolerances. When the task is completed, the battery’s temperature gradually cools back down to an idle temperature of ~36 ℃. Using the MacBook in clamshell mode surprisingly has little effect on its thermals from my testing. The thermal management of the M1 MacBook Air is very impressive for a fan-less device.

Conclusion
Overall, the M1 MacBook Air is an excellent machine in 2025, with its iconic, classy, and timeless design. It continues to demonstrate the real meaning of value and performance. Like I said before, the power and performance that you get with an M1 MacBook Air is greater than that of a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an Intel i9 processor. When that machine came out, it cost almost USD$4000. Many professionals still use that machine till this date for work. In 2025, the slogan for the M1 MacBook still stands true today: “Power. It’s in the Air.”

As an audio professional, I have completed several projects using a base model 2013 MacBook Air with 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD. Projects were stored on an external drive, and the internal drive used exclusively for the OS and its applications. That laptop is still running flawlessly today. Fast forward to 2023 when I purchased my M1 MacBook Air with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD. Performance is flawless, and the value is unmatched. This laptop has been recommended by almost everyone in the tech industry over the M2 MacBook Air as the best laptop to buy in 2020-2024 until Apple removed it from their website. M2 runs hotter and is less efficient than M1, making its gains negligible in the chassis of a fan-less MacBook Air. With the M3 MacBook Air, Apple has improved upon the shortcomings of the M2 MacBook Air. They have brought back dual NAND chips for SSD speeds compatible with the M1 MacBook Air, and with the new 3-nanometer architecture of the M3, efficiency and thermal performance have improved. In my experience, the M2 MacBook Air is the one to skip. If you are looking for value and performance, get the M1 MacBook Air, and if you are looking for the latest, get the M3 MacBook Air. Both machines, in their base configuration, are fully capable of professional audio, video, and photo editing.",True,5 people found this helpful
,4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2022","Updated review with more detail [after 2 weeks]. ** See additional note re color.

I switched to Mac 11 years ago, and for that entire period, I had the same laptop, a Macbook Pro, late-2011 model. After the initial adjustment, it has been a great laptop for all of these years. I used it for school, work, online browsing, a few applications, and streaming videos. I have never gamed on my 2011 laptop. Of course, it slowed down considerably after several years, and software and hardware updates can only help so much with an older model. So, I finally decided to purchase a new laptop, and based on my research on recent macbook models, the price and value was right on this 2020 Macbook Air.

GENERAL FEATURES: Switching from a Pro to an Air model is weird at first because the Air is SO thin and lightweight. It has an extremely slim profile. I have to be extra careful when I grab the laptop to move to another room. Like other reviewers have said, the screen extends almost to the edge with minimal bezel, which also means very minimal border, so you are getting a ""larger"" screen. I did not mind the thick bezel black border on my pro and have been used to it for so long, but I took for granted that it actually provided a lot of protection for my screen. The macbook air has almost no bezel, which in my opinion, is not ideal. Let's hope it doesn't drop or get off balance because there is basically no protection for the screen. My older macbook pro has fallen a few times on it's corner or edge in 11 years and been fine, aside from minor cosmetic damage. But the larger edge and bezel came in really handy on the macbook pro when it lost balance and fell off the counter several years ago, but I quickly saved it by grabbing it by the screen and significantly reducing the impact when it landed [luckily not on hard floor]. Obviously not an ideal way to grab it, but it was a necessary save in that moment. The only damage was cracks through the top of my screen from the pressure of my palm, and some minor dent in the bottom of the laptop. Cosmetic damage, but thankfully did not effect the screen light, LCD, or anything else. I do not think the macbook air would survive this, especially how the screen is built.

BATTERY: Upon opening the box, the battery life was already pretty high, and I decided not to charge it until the battery decreased to around 10-15%. I was still using my original macbook during the day for work, and the new macbook air during the evening for mostly online use and going through all of the system preferences and settings, and watching youtube in the background. Keeping that limited use in mind, I did not need to charge it for maybe 1 week. Great battery life thus far. I will likely be shifting to use this macbook air for work soon, in order to take advantage of the current OS, higher ram, and M1 chip, especially because I connect to virtual servers, which can take a toll on the ram and processor.

SPEED/PORTS/BLUETOOTH: Compared to an older model pro, it has good speeds so far. I already knew that the number of ports have been reduced significantly, and that air has less ports than a pro anyway, so I purchased a thunderbolt adapter and a USB hub in advance to take care of that issue. So far, the thunderbolt adapter works fine to connect the macbook air to my Thunderbolt Display monitor. The bluetooth was able to connect to my ear buds, although pairing did take a bit longer than I expected. The bluetooth preferences do seem to be less detailed/less options than my previous macbook pro.

CHARGER: ** In my opinion, the previous magnetic chargers were superior to the current ones. They attached via magnet, the indicator light was red while charging, and green when fully charged. Easy and convenient. The mag-safe charger on this computer requires an additional push to be plugged in fully. This is just like most electronic devices, so it is not a bad feature, just requires an adjustment. It is probably safer for the computer and prevents it from easily coming unplugged. However, there is no indicator light, so you can't tell that it is plugged in and successfully charging unless you look at the battery status in the menu bar, and you also cannot see when it is finished charging just at a glance. You cannot confirm when the laptop is closed or on lock screen. You have to open the laptop, log in, and then check. Big bummer. **

MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES: My previous macbook had a great feature: check the battery life at a glance with a quick push of a button while the laptop is still closed. After some additional research, I realized that apple removed the battery light indicator on the macbook pros many years ago, and that airs never had this feature. Big bummer. There is no way to check the battery life on this model without opening the laptop AND logging in, as the battery status in the menu bar on lock screen only shows the icon, but won't show you the percentage until you log in. Not ideal at all.

Quick review for recently purchased product [during Black Friday]. I will update with a more detailed review once I have used it for a longer period.
***** Important Note: If you are on the fence about purchasing the ""gold,"" don't get it. I had a silver MacBook Pro for many years, and I went back and forth for several days about the gold, especially after reading recent reviews and viewing customer images on multiple retailers that said the gold is closer to rose gold. I would disagree and say that the color is actually better described as dark blush pink or dark a reddish-mauve. Definitely not the look I wanted to have, and I regret not purchasing the staple silver, especially as I keep my electronics for many years beyond the 'normal time.' It would be a hassle and a lot of money to purchase the silver instead, since we cannot exchange in-store.",True,322 people found this helpful
,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2022","UPDATE 3/8/2023: i bought parallels desktop and a windows 11 license. I need it to try a certain amount of things in IT, however, the performance when running windows in a virtualized environment (like parallels is) it gets seriously affected on the M1, something that didn't happen with intel processors. You notice the performance degrading (but not that much, maybe 10, or even 15% i risk to say) when switching between full screens and main desktop with windows (full separate screen, remember that there's an option to seamlessly integrate within your macOS). You kinda feel the stutter but i can see the M1 processor get in the way and prioritize the screen, and that's a good thing to re-prioritize tasks that are being done in one screen or another (take the word ""screen"" as full-screen apps or software that switches between desktop and full-screen apps or between apps). In my case, running windows 11 makes the mbp m1 run hotter than i'm really use to, but it does not affect battery performance as much as i expected!... weird, isn't it?... love it!

If you're going to virtualize something, that isn't Windows, you shouldn't worry that much on this laptop. Just remember that's still have 8gb ram and usable 228gb, therefore, performance wouldn't be the same as bare metal.

Still, other regular software from apple or safari (or any other browser), Office365, Adobe XD, Photoshop do not affect performance nor consume that much battery, although if you are a graphic designer or a photographer making a quick change could make you brighten your screen, in which may lead to higher power consumption, which also could be confused by software running.

One bad thing that i found with heavy usage is that the keyboard gets ""oily"", meaning, it wears in time and amount of usage per day; funny enough, the aluminum part of the palm rest don't have any signs of wear.

Another thing that i found is that the left speaker sounds like it broke when hearing at 70% volume, i don't know if that's fixable or not, anywho anyhow... i'm gonna stick with that because i rarely use it.

One thing that i've also found is how i got used to the fact that this mbp m1 takes nothing to return from suspended state, why? Because no matter what other laptop i use (or desktop, for that matter), all of them takes a few seconds to access to their respective desktops and another few seconds to actually be productive (after booting software)... This one literally takes nothing to wake and start using it... that's why i'm not changing this laptop... and yes, even with its flaws... why? because in critical cases when i need to go somewhere and fast react to do something at work, i just do it! it takes me 0 seconds to wake up the mbp and enter another desktop via anydesk or teamviewer or ssh... this takes time on most windows laptops... i love it!

I just wish this laptop was upgradeable... after all at the end of the day, it makes my life so useful and convenient despite the down side of it... what a masterpiece! i just wish i could do more and more with it, i feel limited... but happy!

and by the way, i still stand on my original review.

ORIGINAL:
I believe i've found my unicorn because this particular macbook air still lasts an insane amount of time! Although i don't use it on full brightness, i regulate it a lot. Connecting several devices to it via bluetooth is transparent, but unfortunately, Apple made the macOS more inconvenient to handle in terms of simplicity.

User experience on the macOS is weird, you know as a mac user where things used to be, then you have to relearn some things and it doesn't feel like home, the new normal isn't good so far.

Keyboard is relatively quiet, also, there's the missing keyboard light on this iteration of the macbook air, why did you take (probably) the most useful key from us?! if you're watching a movie you have to literally stop the movie, go through the menu from above and turn off the keyboard lights, or if you're on a presentation and everything is dark, you just turn your screen light down but you can't with your keyboard because you need to actually stop paying attention to the presentation and go through the menu, inconvenient as heck!

I know (and i'm very well aware) that there are some workarounds to change to the keyboard light again using a small software... but that isn't the end-game, the thing is that we shouldn't need an extra software or aditional configuration just to use something the macbook had for, literally, over 10 years!

Speed on this macbook: you don't even feel it... everything is instant, nothing is slow, if something is, it's most likely the software or the website you're on, is that simple! If you're planning on using massive storage, you should use an usb-c one, not an usb-a through usb-c dongle, you will have a bottleneck, that's guaranteed.

I haven't used it on games because that's why i have my pc and xbox for. However, if you're planning on developing software on it, just make sure your libraries fit within 228gb (the half of it is recommended for all ssd's) of storage, if that's gonna be an issue, then go for usb-c massive storage.

Weight isn't a problem, it makes you feel like you're having a premium laptop on your hands, but not enough to make your bag heavier. Construction feels like you own something premium and well-made.",True,252 people found this helpful

I looked at many sellers’ ratings, sellers’ reviews and so many product reviews and shipping times. I also searched online to see if the laptops I was interested in would be able to receive Apple updates (at least until I could invest more money in a new one). I decided on this laptop from a highly rated seller. I knew, based on their ratings, reviews, and Amazon’s track record, that I can return the laptop if there are issues. When the MacBook arrived, I figured there would be a scratch or ding, but there’s nothing. I took this out of the box and it looked absolutely brand new! I thought it would take the almost dead battery a long while to charge. It only took 1 to 1 1/2 hours AND the laptop was able to update to the newest OS with no issues at all! I’ve been using this since the day I got it. Zoom, videos, classes, multitasking…no issues. I am so pleased and so impressed with this purchase.

,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024","I bought the MacBook Air M1 two years ago because I was starting my first year as a CS major. I purchased the MacBook with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB hard drive. I've used this laptop for coding, professional video editing with software like Adobe, and daily tasks.

I have to say, I LOVE this laptop. It's lightweight and portable. You can quite literally hold it open or closed with one hand, and it doesn't take up much space. I love the feature where the keyboard lights up, which is especially handy since I consider myself a night owl.

The battery life is AMAZING. I've never worried about overheating with this laptop. I write my code and do video editing on this device, so I'm using it for long periods, and the battery has never been an issue since it can last 6+ hours.

The performance has always been good. The MacBook has a feature where you can have multiple desktops open. I typically have one desktop with all my video editing software and another with all my coding software. I have never experienced lag or delay whatsoever. The movement between different desktops is effortless since there's a keyboard shortcut to switch between them.

The speaker on the MacBook Air is also very good.

My only complaint would be that the camera is horrible. I was honestly shocked at how bad the camera quality is for this laptop, but it wasn’t a feature I was looking for.

I decided this week to switch over to Windows 11 Pro because most of the software I need is found on Windows. I honestly would have just upgraded to the MacBook with the M3 chip if Apple supported the applications I needed. That sucks because I honestly adore Apple products.",True,One person found this helpful

So this is actually my first laptop. I’ve never been able to afford one and recently got a work from home job that required one. I wasn’t sure what to look for buying a laptop.

I read reviews on several different styles of Mac, and went with this, as it seemed to be the best value for the price. Knowing it was an older version I was fine with that as I wasn’t looking for top-of-the-line for what I’m using it for.

Something to consider is that the screen is fairly small. my coworkers are surprised that I’m able to use a screen as small as this I like the size of the laptop overall and it’s not too heavy to have to transport so it works perfectly for me.

I would say that it holds charge for a decent amount of time and it ends up charging very quickly when plugged in. I like the appearance I like the fact that it connects with my iPhone. It was a new experience for me being able to read and respond to text on a laptop and it’s some thing that I enjoy doing.

I can’t speak to any other functions that people might consider when buying a laptop as I’m not doing anything Very exciting with this.

,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2023","The M1 ""Air"" laptop is all that most people need for general purpose use - it has 8 GB of memory and 256 GB of solid state disk and an excellent 13.3 inch screen - plenty for email, light word processing, light gaming, school work, light artwork, has a good built-in camera, microphone and speakers, etc. Mac computers come with an excellent complement of easy-to-use Mac software for general purpose use and, recently, Stacksocial has been offering a great deal on MS Office 2021 for Mac that extends that ecosystem to the Mac, too. It is fast, responsive, extremely reliable, and is very easy and pleasant to use. Most people only use 30 to 50 GB of ""disk"" storage (this computer uses much faster solid state disk - not less-reliable and slower hard disk). It is comparatively light and thin as laptops go and is easy to carry. The power supply is not clunky and attaches magnetically. All-in-all a good choice, especially at its current discounted price. The M1 generation of Mac chips is similar to but not quite as fast as the M2 generation but is architecturally very similar - there is little to fear that the M1 will become obsolete in the near future. The *one* drawback is that this computer has only 2 Thunderbolt ports for wired connections. Thus, if you want to have a hardwired Ethernet connection (faster and more secure) than the built-in WiFi, you need to buy an external Thunderbolt (not just a USB C-type) dock that includes an Ethernet port. Similarly, if you want to use the computer with a larger, say a 24 or a 27 inch screen you need to have an HDMI port on the dock. And if you have other kinds of devices that you use that have USB A connections the dock must have those, too. There are several reliable docks on the market, so if you need one, they are available. Just make sure that the dock has the kinds and number of ports that you need. I recommend this computer if you need a light and very portable general purpose Mac.",True,78 people found this helpful

I was skeptical about buying from amazon because of the reviews… i did tons of research and learned that amazon buys wholesale and sale for cheaper bc of the profit they make from accessories , etc… ANYWAYs. I received the mac completely dead which caused me to panic. It took about 20 minutes to get a charge and power on. I began researching ways to figure out if the battery was damaged or if this was a brand new mac… turns out this charge is the first charge this mac has had and the battery level is “normal” i figured it set on the shelf a while because it came with OSVentura.

i have set up my mac, of course it was super easy because i have all mac devices : phone, ipad, and imac.

overall im in love all over again with this mac. i’ll update in a few months if anything changes. This mac is fragile, simple because of it’s weight. It’s a no brainer that one needs to carefully use this computer when closing it, traveling, etc. I had no problems with my previous mac and it would fall on the carpet numerous of time lol. i used my previous mac for school, work, and personal use and the 256 GB was just fine.

,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2021","I'm a software developer and I've only used PC for my entire career. I've been using the windows subsystem for Linux and other Unix based shells for work for a long time and I've always had the desire to try development on a Mac.

I assumed that it would be like any other Windows machine that's had the OS replaced with Linux, one of my favorite computers was a Lenovo with Ubuntu on it so that's what I expected.

I bought a Surface Pro X which has an ARM based processor (ms sq1 chip) so I thought that I knew what to expect, I assumed that it would be frustrating that the majority of the software I used probably wouldn't work correctly but I have to say that Apple did so much better than Microsoft on this one. The M1 chip makes this $1,000 laptop feel like a $2500 laptop. I've only run into one application that couldn't run and the general online community recommended an alternative for me.

the most difficult thing for me was getting used to the different keyboard layout but once I did, this laptop has been nothing short of a pleasure to work with and has replaced my Surface laptop 3 as my daily driver and primary software development machine.

I might revert to my Surface laptop three if I go back to .NET development in the future but for the general web stuff I typically do, I couldn't ask for a better machine.

The battery life is excellent, this laptop feels premium, I have no doubt that this will last me well into the future and it has completely changed my mind about Apple.

The biggest downside in my opinion is that I spent a fortune on accessories and peripherals because Apple products tends to exist in their own separate ecosystem which can be a bit frustrating.

One thing that everyone should be aware of is that you can't connect this laptop to two separate external displays. I had to get used to One external display and then using a virtual desktop. That is unfortunate because I really liked having three monitors at all times but I haven't found a way to make it work with this machine.

Generally speaking, I would recommend this to anybody who's considering it. Unless you are a PC gamer, there's very little that this computer won't excel at. I'd argue that it might be the best quality laptop in this price range by a factor of two, and I have historically been very critical of Apple.",True,49 people found this helpful

,4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2024","One of the most striking advantages of the MacBook M1 is its exceptional battery life. Thanks to the efficiency of the M1 chip, users can enjoy extended usage without constantly searching for power outlets. This makes it an ideal choice for students, professionals, and anyone on the go.

Moreover, the performance of the MacBook M1 is astonishing. Whether you're editing videos, coding, or browsing the web, the MacBook M1 handles every task with ease.

Additionally, the MacBook M1 features a stunning Retina display that offers vibrant colors, sharp details, and excellent contrast.

However, there are a couple of drawbacks worth mentioning:

• The limited Port Selection: The minimalistic design that sacrifices port variety for sleekness. With only two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports available, users may find themselves needing additional dongles or adapters to connect multiple peripherals simultaneously.

• Limited Upgrade Options: The MacBook Air M1 is not user-upgradeable, meaning that components like RAM and storage are soldered onto the motherboard and cannot be easily replaced or upgraded after purchase. This lack of upgradeability can be frustrating for users who prefer to customize their laptops over time.

Despite its lack of ports and limited upgradeability, the MacBook M1 remains a top choice for those seeking uncompromising performance in a sleek and portable package.",True,2 people found this helpful

This is the M1 MacBook Air. I purchased it shortly after the M2 MacBook Air came out. It was 18 months old but that's what provided the exceptional price. The M2 based MacBook would be faster and offered MagSafe charging, and a brighter display. There were also several handy ports lacking on the M1 model. But the M2 has an overheating problem that the M1 doesn't. I didn't think these features were work several hundred more dollars.
This M1 MacBook is fast enough and has reasonably good battery life. But there are a few drawbacks that I was aware of before I made the purchase:
The only ports are a headphone jack and two Thunderbolt connectors. To solve this issue, I bought a small dock.
You're buying the base model with a 128g solid state drive. This is less than ideal but there are workarounds. First, you can purchase an inexpensive drive (solid state if possible) and offload some things to that drive. Another option is to upgrade your iCloud storage to 50gb for .99 cents a month.

The limitation of the Iphone for some advanced features (like dual SIM and the possibility to flash OS images from a ssd) and the need to use bootcamp in the Mac made me jump to an android phone and a windows computer.

I had a Samsung s10+ and a Huawei Matebook pro with windows and linux. Both devices are impeccable. Really made my work easier in so many aspects. But as time passed my life wasn't getting simpler like it was with my Iphone and my Mac.

Apple products work flawlessly between each other and there are always new implementations that simplifies everyday life. Quality of this products and its software is incredible. Although other products have better capabilities ( for example my Matebook outperforms this MacBook Air m1 and has a much better quality screen) they lack the simplicity and stability.

Being all this said, The MacBook Air M1 is a really great laptop. The most basic version which is the one I bought is blazing fast, stable and with a great battery life (much better than the Huawei Matebook pro). Also its absolute silent and fresh. Its doesn't get hot at all.

To make my work easier I had to pay for some software that saddly I was denied to pay on the Mac at the beginning. Apple products are expensive but I've learned that in the long run they are worth it. Life is about time and how you spend it and apple definitely focus its effort to simplify the time you use to do a task.

I wanted to share my story in case you are in a situation like I had. If you have an iPhone and other Apple products don't doubt. Buy a Macbook Air M1.

The screen was weird, but since it was under warranty Apple replaced it for free. The build quality is excellent. The solid metal construction simply cannot be broken under normal use. It's great for school and home use. The only issue with gaming is that it overheats, and of course, not very many games are available on the Mac, so not the computer's fault. This is a 10/10 laptop would recommend it to anyone else looking for a small, portable, and powerful laptop.

Speaking of power, this thing FLIES. It handles any task I throw at it. I tried video editing the other day, and it handles my 4K timeline so easily.

,4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2023","I’m a big Apple fan. I usually use Macbook Pros for work. I decided to get the Air for the days when I don’t need the Pro with me. I like the size and the weight, but there are little glitches here and there that are just very annoying to me. Photos can’t crop more than two pictures at the time without glitches. I do the same on the Pro, no problem. This is easy work and has nothing to do with how ‘powerful’ your computer is. I’m talking about cropping regular phone size pics for social media. No filters or animations or anything like this. It can’t do that.

Sometimes when you try to write a post on social media, the space bar moves cursor up as an arrow, rather than a space, usually when you get to the second paragraph of your post. I haven’t noticed this in Pages, just social media. These are small things but when you’re in a hurry, they can be very annoying. The button to change languages is very temperamental, sometimes works, sometimes doesn’t. If you’re trying to write a social media post in two different languages, good luck. You have to select outside of the post pop-up in order to change your language every single time. And IDK, it might be just mine that is doing this, but it’s making me stay away from everything Air.

As far as Amazon shipment, delivery and so on, no complains. Everything was as expected for this item.",True,25 people found this helpful

Using this was a pleasure from the keyboard to the color and clarity of the screen. It feels good in the hand and seems like a very premium and quality product I use this laptop for a job one day recently and literally at full brightness for around 8 1/2 hours on its battery. What I found is I liked it so much that I added more applications to make this my daily laptop but the standard 8 GB it came with just wasn’t enough. I was getting RAM full warnings at least once or twice a day. I have since given this laptop to my wife who had a 2011 Air and have purchased a new 16 GB M2 version for myself. As nice and robust, and as good looking as this laptop, is I highly recommend it but if you think for a moment that you might need extra ram, go ahead and bump up to the next level. in my opinion, this is the best $1000 laptop on the market with the best battery life and quality overall.",True,11 people found this helpful

,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2022","I'm no tech expert. The last laptop I owned was a 2015 MacBook Pro (13-inch), which I used daily until the battery became too weak to hold a charge for more than a couple of hours. That's normal after you've gone through the standard 1000 recharge cycles and seven years of use. It served me well.

I pretty much only use this thing to write Amazon reviews and so far it's doing the job well. I will say the Air is the lowest model of the MacBooks and I bought the 2020 M1 model rather than the newest one available for 2022. Going from a 2015 Pro, I noticed this machine is noticeably stronger in performance. It's also lighter and quieter because it has no cooling fans (doesn't really heat up so it doesn't need them).

My only real complaint I'll say at this point is the lack of ports. You get two USB-C ports and a regular headphone jack. I'm glad they at least decided to keep the headphone jack. So you'll most likely need to buy a dongle or some adapter to expand your ports which then makes the laptop clunky and less portable.

I'll finish with this - if you don't know the pros and cons of buying an Apple vs non-Apple (usually Windows-based) laptop, definitely look that up. There are basics you should know like Apple is not gaming-friendly and installing software in their OS vs Windows is quite different.",True,24 people found this helpful

I received my MacBook and instantly fell in love with it. When I unpacked the MacBook, I didn’t see anything immediately wrong with it physically. I checked all over and she was looking 👀 right. However, when I checked over it, it was under low lighting. Almost like meeting someone in the club/bar lighting…🤦🏽‍♂️. The next day, I brought it to work and saw her in bright lighting and was shocked 🫢. There are multiple scuffs and scratches on the lid, scratches on the mouse pad area, and there’s also a noticeable smudge on the “Apple” logo. I can only assume that this device is pre-owned due to the noticeable scratches and scuffs, and if that’s the case, SAY IT IN THE DESCRIPTION! Paying the price I did for moderately used good is ridiculous.

Other than the scratches and scuffs, I haven’t had an issue with the MacBook itself. Processor speed is totally amazing and the graphics are great.

Not even interested in discussing ""cons"" because there aren't any if you weigh up the price point fairly for what is arguably the best ultra portable laptop on the market right now (July 21') and I don't mean the fastest.

The ""only two"" thunderbolt slots can be dongled out to the max.

The 7 cores of GPU on this model won't be noticed vs 8 cores. The machine is a beast. I'm using Lumafusion to process video (not even designed for MacOS but ports across from iPadOS) and it's 3X as fast as the iPad Pro that I own - 2019

Best laptop I've ever owned and I've owned two earlier MacBook pro's, a Mac mini, several windows laptops, and the Dell S2721Q 27 Inch 4K UHD monitor I purchased here is parked on top of the last windows machine I purchased.

The 4K dell monitor is easily crisp enough for MacOS and I purchased the keyboard used and Magic Mouse (2) new, on Amazon.

It's been a while since I've been on MacOS and would describe it as wonderful to use and look at, after coming from windows 10. Sidecar is also amazing (using the iPad Pro to the right for that)

It was only two years old and rarely used until I started a new job and school. I had my MacBook going from 8:30 AM to 8:30 PM pretty much consistently, and it still had 55% battery life. Because I have an iPhone, I can make calls and send texts with it. My iPad can be used for sidecar, which is basically wireless screen mirroring, allowing me to have a portable second monitor. The mac doesn’t skip a beat- I can leave it closed overnight, and everything is exactly the same the next morning without crashing or reloading. It’s not at all heavy, and the size is exactly what a laptop should be. The Mac OS not supporting steam titles thing isn’t a huge deal- If I want a gaming machine, I have a desktop. For getting things done, this is an absolutely perfect daily driver, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

For heavier tasks, it of course doesn’t last all day but you get a lot of hours out of the battery. It rarely gets hot, and doesn’t even have a fan, so you know how efficient that chip is running. I also love the fanless design because I can have it with me in my bed or anywhere and not worry about blocking vents or getting dog hair in those fans. I don’t use it for anything crazy, mainly just work and personal stuff, along with frequent streaming and occasionally I’ll fire up the Sims 4 (and it runs beautifully by the way).

I find it the right size for the job I am doing and take advantage of Apples cloud storage and ways of using other Mac's as storage for information so this doesn't use storage much at all. Where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road. Most of the time I am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new Mac Mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information. I find that the size makes a great traveling companion for onsite work. When connecting to a shared internet connection it is nice knowing that the channel is mostly secure and when using my iPhone shares cell connection and new chips they can help create a safe network for my means of work. If you are debating getting one for business I recommend using their cloud storage so you eliminate the focus on storage anxiety and makes it more worth it in the long run of having a user interface focused laptop.

Yes, Apple is advancing with the M2 and M3 processors, and the 15"" Air has a beautiful display, but for less than $1,000 you can't beat the M1 MacBook Air.",True,29 people found this helpful
,4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2021","What I liked: Apple's construction quality is second to none. Unboxing this is a delight, it's just a beautiful machine. You can start working with it as soon as the initial setup is done, which might take a few minutes. Love the display, bright colors, nice resolution, everything looks crisp. Keys are a delight to type with, real smooth. Battery life is the best I've ever witnessed, I just recharge this thing every other day, whereas my previous laptop would use three rounds of charge a day (and I had for just one year).

What I disliked: some of my favorite apps are still not ready for Apple Silicon or M1 chip. It's given me two or three random reboots with cryptic error logs already. And coming from over 25 years using mostly Windows (and some 2-3 years using Linux) I feel like I have to rewire my brain to start using the fn, control, option & command keys properly.

All in all, it's a really solid laptop although I feel like I still haven't made the most out of it. No heavy usage so far, except for some minor audio production work. Guess I'll do it eventually. Hope app compatibility gets better with time too, that's the reason for the missing star up there, otherwise, it would've been 5-stars all the way.",True,One person found this helpful
