Ceban A.,5,1 month ago,"H o provato questa lozione idratante viso e corpo e sono rimasto davvero colpito dalla sua efficacia e delicatezza. La formula √® leggera e si assorbe rapidamente, senza lasciare residui untuosi, ma mantenendo la pelle incredibilmente morbida e idratata per tutta la giornata. La sensazione di freschezza √® immediata, e la pelle risulta visibilmente pi√π luminosa e vellutata. Una delle cose che ho apprezzato di pi√π √® la sua versatilit√†: √® adatta sia per il viso che per il corpo, il che la rende perfetta per chi cerca un unico prodotto per tutto il corpo. Nonostante la sua leggerezza, offre un‚Äôidratazione profonda, che dura senza bisogno di riapplicare durante il giorno, anche nelle zone pi√π secche. La profumazione √® delicata, quasi impercettibile, il che la rende adatta anche a chi ha la pelle sensibile o preferisce cosmetici senza fragranze forti. Inoltre, la consistenza della lozione √® abbastanza fluida da essere facilmente spalmata, ma abbastanza ricca da garantire un‚Äôidratazione profonda. In generale, consiglio vivamente questa lozione a chi cerca un prodotto idratante versatile, che non solo ammorbidisca la pelle, ma che la lasci anche visibilmente sana e curata. Perfetta per l‚Äôuso quotidiano, √® un vero alleato contro la secchezza della pelle.",,

Kathleen D.,5,1 year ago,"As I Content Creator, I get sent a lot of prestige and luxe brands, so I use those a lot. However, I bought this CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion last year for the first time, and it's REALLY fantastic! I've always hated lotion. I just don't like the feeling of having it on my skin, but this lotion doesn't make me feel that way. It's very gentle, it's not greasy, it's not heavy, it doesn't leave a film, and it actually does help to moisturize my skin. It's also an inexpensive, accessible brand, and a big bottle of the lotion (19oz) lasted me almost a year! I just bought a new one, and I'm very happy with this product overall! I highly recommend it to anyone with skin!! :)",,

I have tried soooo many different face lotions and ALWAYS come back to this one. It is the only face lotion that doesn‚Äôt make my skin break out. It always makes it feel soft and hydrated. My routine is super simple, I watched an episode of Doctorly and he was talking about how you just need a good face wash, a good lotion and a good sunscreen, everything else is extra if you want. So I simplified my routine and my skin has never been better. I use the CeraVe Hydrating Face Wash AM and PM and put this on after. In the AM I put the E.L.F vitamin C serum on after and then follow it up with this lotion and at night every 3 days I use peach slices SA exfoliating toner with this lotion. It never burns or makes my face itchy. It literally always makes it so soft and plump. My face isn‚Äôt dry or oily at the end of the day like other lotion makes me, it‚Äôs just simply hydrated and soft.",,

Sorina D.,5,1 year ago,"Adoro questa crema idratante, nella sua semplicit√†. Innanzitutto √® multitasking e si pu√≤ usare sia per il corpo che per il viso. Il mio utilizzo preferito √® per il corpo, ma qualche volta l'ho applicata anche sulla pelle del viso e mi ha piacevolmente sorpresa. Ha una consistenza leggera e morbida, si spalma facilmente senza lasciare scia bianca e si assorbe in pochissimo tempo, permettendo di rivestirsi in fretta. Ha un profumo delicatissimo, quasi impercettibile, che a me piace molto. Nonostante sia leggera, idrata benissimo la pelle, la rende morbida e liscia, si percepisce che questa idratazione √® reale e non rimane solamente in superficie. Infatti, anche se dimentico qualche applicazione, la pelle rimane comunque morbida e nutrita. Adoro la piacevolezza di applicazione e la sensazione che lascia sulla pelle. Sicuramente la riacquister√≤.",,

I can feel the difference in how hydrated my skin is, especially during the dry winter months. It has significantly improved the overall health and appearance of my skin. The texture of this lotion is another commendable aspect. It is lightweight and non-greasy, making it easy to apply and quickly absorb into the skin. Unlike other moisturizers I have tried in the past, it does not leave any residue or stickiness behind. It simply melts into the skin, providing an instant surge of moisture. Speaking of absorption, this lotion is absorbed by the skin effortlessly. It sinks in within seconds.The quick absorption helps to prevent any transfer onto clothing, which is definitely a bonus! Lastly, the packaging of the CeraVe Daily moisturizing Lotion is simple yet practical. The pump dispenser allows for easy and controlled application, preventing any product wastage. Additionally, the bottle itself is sturdy and convenient to carry around, making it perfect for travel or on-the-go use.",,

I noticed that my skin is less sensitive when I use this, probably because of the ceramides. It has never caused any irritation, the product is fragrance-free. It actually has a light smell, but it seems like it‚Äôs just a natural scent of the added ingredients, nothing added artificially to it. Works best if applied right after the shower, when the skin is still a bit wet (a general rule for applying the hyaluronic acid product), so it can lock in the moisture. The packaging is high quality, I appreciate it has a pump which makes the application process easier and hygienic.",,

Maria So,4,1 year ago,"I've been using CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion for a while now, and it's been a reliable part of my skincare routine. This lotion is fragrance-free, which is a big plus for sensitive skin like mine. It hydrates well and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth throughout the day. The pump bottle makes it convenient to use, and a little goes a long way, so it lasts a while. However, the reason I'm giving it 4/5 is that I wish it absorbed a bit faster. It can feel slightly greasy for a short time after application, which may not be ideal for those in a hurry. Overall, though, this lotion is effective and budget-friendly. If you don't mind a slightly longer absorption time, it's definitely worth a try for maintaining healthy, moisturized skin.",,
