Ceban A.,5,2025-02-26,"H o provato questa lozione idratante viso e corpo e sono rimasto davvero colpito dalla sua efficacia e delicatezza. La formula √® leggera e si assorbe rapidamente, senza lasciare residui untuosi, ma mantenendo la pelle incredibilmente morbida e idratata per tutta la giornata. La sensazione di freschezza √® immediata, e la pelle risulta visibilmente pi√π luminosa e vellutata. Una delle cose che ho apprezzato di pi√π √® la sua versatilit√†: √® adatta sia per il viso che per il corpo, il che la rende perfetta per chi cerca un unico prodotto per tutto il corpo. Nonostante la sua leggerezza, offre un‚Äôidratazione profonda, che dura senza bisogno di riapplicare durante il giorno, anche nelle zone pi√π secche. La profumazione √® delicata, quasi impercettibile, il che la rende adatta anche a chi ha la pelle sensibile o preferisce cosmetici senza fragranze forti. Inoltre, la consistenza della lozione √® abbastanza fluida da essere facilmente spalmata, ma abbastanza ricca da garantire un‚Äôidratazione profonda. In generale, consiglio vivamente questa lozione a chi cerca un prodotto idratante versatile, che non solo ammorbidisca la pelle, ma che la lasci anche visibilmente sana e curata. Perfetta per l‚Äôuso quotidiano, √® un vero alleato contro la secchezza della pelle.",,

My routine is super simple, I watched an episode of Doctorly and he was talking about how you just need a good face wash, a good lotion and a good sunscreen, everything else is extra if you want. So I simplified my routine and my skin has never been better. I use the CeraVe Hydrating Face Wash AM and PM and put this on after. In the AM I put the E.L.F vitamin C serum on after and then follow it up with this lotion and at night every 3 days I use peach slices SA exfoliating toner with this lotion.

Nicola Ma,5,2024-02-04,This moisturiser is the best one I ever tried. It has a cream texture that is lightweight but moisturises the skin really well.

It is very hydrating and soothes any irritation that the skin might have without causing flare ups. It is perfect for prepping the skin for makeup in the morning which prevents my makeup from looking cakey. I love that it is unscented because it means that it‚Äôs good also for people with sensitive skin and I also love the fact that it comes in a big bottle because you will never run out of the moisturiser and it also comes with a pump which is more efficient to take product out of.

I buy what's rated well and recommended. Jergen's has always been a medium-ish weight to me, but this stuff is much thinner (in a good way) and doesn't leave your face greasy at all. I have a lot of tattoos and I can tell when my skin is dry because my blacks look ashy. Lotion is a must for me and this stuff definitely does the job. 12 onces will probably last me 2 years. I'll continue to use this on a daily basis and keep my boyish skin moisturized and hydrated like it should be.",,

Nadiia D.,5,2023-11-22,"I think this is one of the best body lotions you can get for this price honestly. It is pretty lightweight yet very moisturizing, I can use it on the whole body, even on my upper back and shoulders which are a bit oily ‚Äî this product doesn‚Äôt cause any breakouts for me and it prevents excessive oiliness due to nice skin hydration. I noticed that my skin is less sensitive when I use this, probably because of the ceramides. It has never caused any irritation, the product is fragrance-free. It actually has a light smell, but it seems like it‚Äôs just a natural scent of the added ingredients, nothing added artificially to it. Works best if applied right after the shower, when the skin is still a bit wet (a general rule for applying the hyaluronic acid product), so it can lock in the moisture. The packaging is high quality, I appreciate it has a pump which makes the application process easier and hygienic.",,

Maria So,4,2023-09-20,"I've been using CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion for a while now, and it's been a reliable part of my skincare routine. This lotion is fragrance-free, which is a big plus for sensitive skin like mine. It hydrates well and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth throughout the day. The pump bottle makes it convenient to use, and a little goes a long way, so it lasts a while. However, the reason I'm giving it 4/5 is that I wish it absorbed a bit faster. It can feel slightly greasy for a short time after application, which may not be ideal for those in a hurry. Overall, though, this lotion is effective and budget-friendly. If you don't mind a slightly longer absorption time, it's definitely worth a try for maintaining healthy, moisturized skin.",,

The viscosity is perfectly formulated so it‚Äôs a decent thickness and rubs down very well into the skin, never feeling too thick/heavy OR thin/watery. When you rub it in, it actually rubs in. There‚Äôs is no ‚Äúsitting on top of the skin‚Äù feeling here. It‚Äôs made for sensitive skin, and there‚Äôs no fragrance, so I‚Äôm able to use it as often as I need.. although I typically stick to morning and nights.

Saima S.,5,2023-08-09,"The Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion is a good, basic lotion. I initially purchased it because I wanted something easily accessible and unscented: it had to be something I could purchase at a pharmacy or at the grocery store (higher end stores mean l'd have to stay after work and travel in Manhattan and I am way too lazy for that), less than $20 (my skin is too dry for me to pay $50 for a bottle I'm going to use up in a matter of weeks), and it had to be unscented (I will sneeze myself to death at the lightest hint of vanilla). I got the Cerave on sale. The texture of the cream is somewhat runny and thin, but it absorbs fairly quickly and does not leave a sticky residue. It's not going to shock and awe you, but it's going to do the job and do it well. I keep it on hand to rotate through my regular skincare so as to give my skin a break from retinoids et al. d 2 Likes ‚Ä¢",,

I was shocked the first time I used it because it did such an amazing job at healing up the dry spots I get on my hands and forehead. Sadly I've stopped using this for the moment because I started to have an allergic reaction (eye swelling) to something, I believe either this or my cerave cleanser. I've switched cleansers but I haven't reintroduced this to my routine yet to see if it was the cause. I used it for about a month before my skin started reacting, but my skin didn't stop reacting badly until cutting out cerave products so I was left with a swelling eye for a month because I really didn't want to stop using this. But I think for people with non-sensitive skin this is a great product!",,

Jens B.,1,2023-06-07,"Die Feuchtigkeitslotion des franz√∂sichen Herstellers CreaVe wurde gem√§√ü Verpackung zusammen mit Dermatologen entwickelt. Sie verspricht dem Kunden, den K√∂rper und das Gesicht mit intensiver Feuchtigkeit zu versorgen und Ihn bei der Erneuerung der Hautschutzbarriere zu versorgen, schnell einzuziehen und den K√∂rper bereits ab der ersten Anwedunung mit ausreichend Feuchtigkeit versorgen. Das praktische Flaschendesign erm√∂glicht ein unkompliziertes auftragen auf die Haut. Die Textur, der Duft und das schnelle Einziehen in die Haut sind sehr angenehm. Leider finden sich in Ihr schwer abbaubares Polymer und zwei bedenktliche Stoffe wie Ceteareth-20 & Disodium Edta. F√ºr meinen Geschmack hat Microplastik nichts in einer Feuchtigkeitslotion zu suchen. Noch schlimmer finde ich, dass dem Kunden versprochen wird, dass die Erneuerung der Hautschutzbarriere durch das Produkt unterst√ºtzt wird, jedoch dann Ceteraeth-20 enthalten ist.

Josephine Si,3,2023-05-26,"Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with the Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion for Normal to Dry Skin. While it claims to be hydrating, I found the consistency of the lotion to be watery and thin, which made it difficult to apply and left my skin feeling dry and parched. I also noticed that the lotion did not absorb into my skin very well and left a slightly sticky residue behind. Additionally, I was not a fan of the scent, which I found to be too strong and overpowering. Overall, I would not recommend this lotion to anyone looking for a truly hydrating and nourishing moisturizer.",,

The only down side I found is that the formula, for me, was pretty greasy upon application and didnt dry down very well. I noticed after a couple hours that my skin was still very greasy from applying this lotion. I would reccomend this as a night time moisturizer only. Will not be repurchasing.",,

Aisha Sa,5,2023-05-11,"Before I used this product , let me tell you‚òùüèª..I didn‚Äôt realise what my skin was missing! Clearly IT WAS THIS! I have eczema prone skin which generally means I‚Äôve been through all the works with moisturisers üò© Aveeno, E45 Diprobase and so on! It would be effective on my skin for a short period of time but not really help my makeup application and just generally making my skin feel heavy and overly oily. I just felt that there was no natural balance. I went to stay at my friends house and had forgotten my cream ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so she let me borrow hers. Which happened to be this cerave one. I had heard a lot about it with all the hyped content on it but never tried it. So I used this before makeup application for my skin prep and GURLLLSSS it is my now must have! When I tell you the difference on how my base went on and how flawless it had me looking. It really said ima give you glass skinnn! It was the right consistency melted into my skin making my dry patches feel nourished and loved. I have since then bought one for myself and one for my makeup kit as it is a GAME CHANGER for us dry skin babes! I‚Äôve been using it ever since and it has stayed a consistent moisturiser for me. I like to pair it with hyaluronic acid in my skin prep and works perfectly for my pm skincare when I need to pair it with the a retinol too. Literally chefs kiss ü§åüèºüíã",,

However, one thing to note is that if you're looking for a product that specifically targets acne, this lotion may not be the best choice.

That being said, if you're looking for a good all-around moisturizer, I would definitely recommend giving this product a try. Overall, I would give the CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion 4 stars.

La sensazione di freschezza √® immediata, e la pelle risulta visibilmente pi√π luminosa e vellutata. Una delle cose che ho apprezzato di pi√π √® la sua versatilit√†: √® adatta sia per il viso che per il corpo, il che la rende perfetta per chi cerca un unico prodotto per tutto il corpo. Nonostante la sua leggerezza, offre un‚Äôidratazione profonda, che dura senza bisogno di riapplicare durante il giorno, anche nelle zone pi√π secche. La profumazione √® delicata, quasi impercettibile, il che la rende adatta anche a chi ha la pelle sensibile o preferisce cosmetici senza fragranze forti. Inoltre, la consistenza della lozione √® abbastanza fluida da essere facilmente spalmata, ma abbastanza ricca da garantire un‚Äôidratazione profonda. In generale, consiglio vivamente questa lozione a chi cerca un prodotto idratante versatile, che non solo ammorbidisca la pelle, ma che la lasci anche visibilmente sana e curata. Perfetta per l‚Äôuso quotidiano, √® un vero alleato contro la secchezza della pelle.",,

After watching TV (what's that?) a dermatologist explained recommended ingredients to look for in lotion, this was the only product possessing those attributes. This is my base to my moisturizing routine, as I have pretty dry skin not to mention aging. There was a period where I had trouble locating product and my skin suffered.

It‚Äôs exactly what my eczema responds to POSITIVELY. I use this on my face after skincare and I use this on my eczema immediately after every shower. I use this about twice-three times a day or just as often when I feel my skin flaky and dry and I feel so relieved afterwards.

Lesya O.,5,2023-02-02,"This is a great cream for dry body. I have a lot of itchiness and sometimes the breakouts of ekzeem and this lotion helps me a lot. It has a good pomp, which easily closes and opens and the pomp doesn't let you have too much of the product, just a good dose of it. The cream looks milky but becomes transparent when I apply it to the skin. It gives me tonns of hydration and is absorbed very quickly - in 1-2 minutes I can put on my clothes. The best usage of it for me is to apply it after shower - when my skin is still a bit damp, this way lotion keeps moisture in and nourishes the body better. The lotion can definately be also used on the face, which I'm using and also as a hand cream and foot cream. This is really a great product which I will now definately buy and always have at home.",,

Lynda Ha,5,2023-01-21,"Pure & Essential When I moved to a mountainous elevated state about a year ago, I found out rather quickly that daily and nightly moisturizing would be a part of my daily routine. The lack of humidity will quickly reek havoc on your skin. Having previously tried CeraVe's sunblock products, it was an easy choice to make when it comes to a body moisturizer. This CeraVe product has that purity that I look for, no nonsense but total quality. I also look for products that are fragrance free as I feel sometimes the scent can mask a lower quality product. A little goes a long way. It is worth it to me to pay a tad bit extra above the store brand. Also, knowing that National Association's endorse CeraVe products is an added stamp of quality. I recommend trying CeraVe anytime for your skin care needs.",,

Marwa Sa,4,2022-12-25,"Some context: I have perpetually dry skin. Every winter, it‚Äôs a struggle to keep my hands moisturized. I‚Äôve tried multiple products and they‚Äôre usually ineffective. I tried CeraVe and I‚Äôd say that it did better than most, but wasn‚Äôt the best moisturizer I‚Äôve tried. Oddly enough, the most effective lotions have been the Bath and Body Works ultimate hydration body creams with hyaluronic acid. However, of course they‚Äôre all scented. Since I love wearing fragrances, I often need an unscented moisturizer so that the lotion‚Äôs scent does not mess with the fragrance. This is where I wanted CeraVe to perform equally well to the B&BW creams. While CeraVe doesn‚Äôt perform as well on my skin, it does keep my skin moisturized for a few hours before I need to reapply. I think it may be more effective for others who have less dry skin.",,

Thank (whatever higher power you choose), because lightweight is a MUST for me. If I put anything remotely cream like on my face I instantly start sweating. No matter what time of the year. If I'm not pouring sweat right away, that means it's going to happen after I get my makeup on. It's so light that it's close to being a water-cream moisturizer. Since l've been using the moisturizer, I started to dip in to other CeraVe products. I couldn't be happier! Way less breakouts, no more dry skin and my skin just looks better overall.",,

So, at that moment, I scrapped my entire routine (hundreds of dollars worth of product), made a trip to Ulta and came across this moisturizer. First, it has ceramides and hyaluronic acid which are very prevalent in the more expensive skincare items. Second, it is fragrance free! My skin is your typical combination, non-behaving skin. It is oily is in the T-zone and dry everywhere else. The older I get, the more sensitive my skin has become. On top of all of that, I tend to get the occasional breakouts, especially when stressed. This lotion absorbs nicely, leaves my face feeling hydrated and comfortable without looking like an oil slick. It's a no fuss, does what it's supposed to do type of product. Forget the fancy glass jars, decorative tubes, and expensive items claiming to work miracles! This has become my new favorite moisturizer over night! I highly recommend for ALL skin types.",,

It wasn't until I turned 25 that I started to get acne and I went on a product binge to try and save my skin. After a couple years of going broke and overloading my pores, I finally saw a dermatologist and I started Acutance. (Oof üòµ‚Äçüí´. It worked) the only lotion my derma recommended that was budget friendly was Cereve. He said it wouldn't clog the pores, no scents, no harsh chemicals and was safe to use on my extremely sensitive skin. It's been 3 years since my Acutance treatment and I still only use Cereve. The lotion is light but hydrating and I appreciate not having a eucalyptus plant shoved up my nose. You don't need artificial fragrances on your skin people! üòÇüëçü§å",,

I am so happy with this moisturizer and tretinoin! And keep in mind I have tried kept tretinoin before with other moisturizers and it never worked out I was so irritated by the Trenton knowing I think the only reason I wasn‚Äôt irritated by it this time was because I use the cereve after! I paid $16 for a giant tub with a pump of this ‚Ä¶I looked at the facial cream that survey has in there the exact same ingredients so I made more sense to buy the giant tub. I will never use another cream at night again and I‚Äôve actually been using this quite a bit during the day too and I‚Äôm absolutely loving it! no more spending $100 on a cream that I end up hating this will always be something I keep in my skin care routine now even if I try other products.

Sandra Sa,3,2022-06-05,"When deciding whether to buy the lotion or cream version of this CeraVe daily moisturizer about 1-1/2 years ago, I decided to go with the cream based on some of the less-than-happy Amazon user reviews for the lotion, and mainly for the fact that body lotions had never been moisturizing enough for me. My skin isn't terribly dry (no flaking, etc.) but it seems that I need a bit more of an emollient product. After going through 3 tubs of the cream (I applied after my evening shower), I had some growing dislikes - not only the stickiness after applying, but the next morning my skin never seemed like it was moisturized enough. So 2 weeka ago I order the lotion and oh boy! After only 3 days of use my skin is now softer throughout a whole day! It goes on so much nicer than the cream too - no stickiness. Never thought I'd be raving about a body lotion - lol. So at this point I'm a believer! I highly recommend this lotion. [product:cerave-daily-moisturizing-lotion-for-normal-to-dry-skin]",,

KC C.,4,2022-06-02,"Doesn't seem to be what it used to be. I have been using CeraVe for the past 20 years or more. This lotion, not the cream sold in a tub. Not sure if they changed their formula but the stuff I've been buying the past 3 years ir so seems a lot thinner and a bit less moisturizing than the older versions. Somewhere when I'm cleaning my messy house I know I'll find an old bottle and will compare the ingredients to see if there's a difference. It's possible they just watered it down, maybe have to call company to ask. I do hate that it has parabens but it's the only decently priced lotion I have found that doesn't break me out and is lightweight and non greasy.

Sophi Ja,5,2022-05-30,"After starting accurate I almost EXCLUSIVELY use this moisturizer. It's pricy compared to some of the other brands, but I find it's worth it. It lasts me a long time, as I only need to use a little at a time. It doesn't leave me feeling oily or like there's an extra layered on my skin, it just feels like it soaks into my skin instead of sitting on top, which is my #1 issue when trying new moisturizers. There's no scent or unnecessary additives so my skin doesn't get irritated. It's really lightweight. My only complaint is of how it feels when I wash my hands, it feels like I have a never-ending supply of soap on my hands when I wash them because the excess lotion is washing off. Still, my favorite moisturizer when I was oily and now that my skin is 10x dryer and flaker than ever, it saves my skin. I have one next to my bed, one in my bathroom, and another in my car.",,

All of those are great but I felt like I needed to go back to basics and just use a very high quality moisturizer to restore my skins barrier. This has been a lifesaver!
