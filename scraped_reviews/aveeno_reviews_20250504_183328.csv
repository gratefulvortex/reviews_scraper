Unknown,0,Unknown,"I've been using Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion specifically for dry skin, and it has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine. The texture is smooth and creamy, but not heavy, which makes it really comfortable to wear throughout the day. It absorbs fast without leaving any greasy residue, which I appreciate, especially when I'm in a rush. The main ingredient—colloidal oatmeal—is excellent for soothing irritation and locking in moisture. Within a few days of consistent use, I noticed my skin felt softer and looked healthier, especially in typically dry areas like my elbows and legs. It's fragrance-free, which is a big plus if you have sensitive skin or don’t like heavily scented products. What I like most is that the hydration lasts all day. I don't feel the need to constantly reapply, even during colder months when my skin tends to be its driest. Pros: Long-lasting moisture Non-greasy and quick-absorbing Great for sensitive skin Fragrance-free Cons: May not be rich enough for extremely dry or cracked skin (you might prefer Aveeno Skin Relief for that) Overall Rating: 4.5/5 If you’re looking for an affordable, gentle daily lotion that actually works for dry skin, Aveeno’s a safe and effective choice",,

Unknown,0,Unknown,"This is a gentle, go-to lotion for both babies and adults. I initially bought it for myself, but it ended up being a staple in my baby brother’s routine too—especially during dry winter months. It’s not overly greasy, absorbs quickly, and has a mild oat scent that doesn’t overwhelm. That said, it’s not a heavy-duty solution for more severe dryness or rashes, but for daily moisturizing, it’s reliable and non-irritating. I like that it feels clean and simple—no fuss.",,
