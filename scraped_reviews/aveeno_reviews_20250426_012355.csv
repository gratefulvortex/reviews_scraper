My son has sensitive, dry skin, and instead of helping, this lotion seemed to make things worse. After a few uses, his skin became even more irritated and itchy. The texture is a bit greasy, and it didn‚Äôt absorb well. It also has a noticeable scent that I didn‚Äôt expect (even though it claims to be gentle). I stopped using it immediately and switched back to our old brand, which gave him relief right away. It might work for other kids, but sadly it didn‚Äôt help mine at all.
