Taniya G.,4,2025-04-17,"It is gentle and really soothing to skin. I have a skin that reacts easily, but this lotion didn’t cause any irritation, redness, or itching. It has no strong fragrance, which I appreciate, and the texture is smooth and lightweight – not greasy at all. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling calm, soft, and well-hydrated throughout the day. It’s especially great after a shower or during colder months when my skin feels extra dry. Overall, it’s a reliable, no-fuss lotion that does exactly what sensitive skin needs without any harsh ingredients.",,

Kathryn Bo,4,2020-02-14,"When my skin was super duper dry, lotion really only seemed to irritate it more. My skin would itch and then lotion would only make it burn. This didn’t. It nourishes the skin and had a pleasant scent. It’s a bit on the more expensive side but nice.",,
