This Aveeno body lotion has a creamy texture and feels very lightweight when applied to skin, it feels so smooth and gentle. Locks in moisture without any greasy feeling, works great for dry skin. If you have sensitive skin or dislike overpowering scents I would recommend this lotion. I preferably like scented body lotions but definitely would be buying again.",,

It's one of the best moisturiser out there. Even my husband is using it, and he can not use any cream as he's allergic to the majority of the ingredients. Skin feels soft and hydrated and absorbs well. I appreciate the lack of perfume. We need more natural products such as this Aveeno Cream. Recommend",,

La Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion me funciona genial cuando tengo la piel seca. Se siente ligera, pero hidrata de verdad y no me deja pegajosa. Me gusta que no tiene olor fuerte ni ingredientes raros, y se nota que cuida la piel con cada uso. Perfecta para todos los d√≠as.",,

This lotion should be vanity staple. It soothes irritated dry skin, and makes your skin silky smooth. It smells good and the pump is easy to use. It is a perfect lotion",,

Absolutely love this lotion. Great to use everyday after showers and as moisturiser. Really subtle smell so perfect if you don‚Äôt like heavily scented moisturisers. Moisture locks into your skin all day, and is overall a great moisturiser to consider using day-to-day.",,

Fantastic product! I use it for my daughter's sensitive skin and it works. It's very moisturising and it gets absorbed fast into the skin. Also I love the bottle, it has a great size and it's easy to use. The best product for dry/sensitive skin. Highly recommend!",,
