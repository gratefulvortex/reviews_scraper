I use it every time I get out of the shower and after a few days of use my itching has stopped and my skin feels noticeably softer. I definitely recommend it I have been using Aveeno Daily Moisturizer everyday since I was 15 years old. I literally cannot live without this lotion and it is by far the most important part of my skincare routine. For years I have gotten compliments on how soft my skin is, and now in my mid 30s, I constantly get comments/compliments on how nice my skin looks.

After using this product consistently for a few weeks, I can confidently say it‚Äôs a game-changer for daily skincare. --- Performance Aveeno‚Äôs claim to provide 24-hour moisture is no exaggeration.

Pros: Convenient pump dispenser Simple yet effective packaging Cons: A travel-size version with a pump would be a great addition. --- Usability This lotion absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving a greasy residue. I‚Äôve used it right after showering, and it locks in moisture effortlessly. It‚Äôs also fragrance-free, which is ideal for layering with perfumes or for those who are sensitive to scents. Pros: Fast absorption Non-greasy finish Fragrance-free Cons: None --- Daily Life Fit I use this lotion every morning and night, and it has seamlessly integrated into my routine.

A great remedy for winter dryness or post-sunburn relief in summer. --- Recommendation If you have dry or sensitive skin and need an affordable, effective, and reliable moisturizing solution, this is the one.

Who it‚Äôs for: People with dry or sensitive skin Those who prefer fragrance-free products Anyone seeking a budget-friendly yet high-quality body lotion --- Final Thoughts Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion has earned a permanent spot in my skincare routine.

Shannon K.,5,2024-10-16,"As someone with inherently dry skin, I've tried countless moisturizers over the years, but few have impressed me as much as Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion. This product has become a staple in my skincare routine, and I‚Äôd love to share my experience with it. One of the first things I noticed about Aveeno‚Äôs lotion is its creamy, yet lightweight texture. It glides effortlessly onto the skin, leaving a soothing sensation that feels both hydrating and comforting. Unlike some heavy creams that take forever to absorb, this lotion sinks in relatively quickly, allowing me to get dressed shortly after application without feeling greasy. Formulated with colloidal oatmeal, this lotion provides deep hydration that lasts throughout the day. I've used it during the harsh winter months and found it effective in combating dryness and flakiness. After consistent use, my skin feels noticeably softer and looks healthier. The moisturizing effect is long-lasting, which helps transition my skin from season to season without any major issues. I've always appreciated Aveeno's commitment to using natural ingredients, and their Daily Moisturizing Lotion is no exception. The presence of colloidal oatmeal is particularly beneficial for those with sensitive skin, as it helps to soothe and protect. I also appreciate that it is fragrance-free, making it suitable for all skin types, especially those prone to irritation. The packaging is practical and user-friendly. The pump bottle is easy to use, and it delivers the perfect amount of product each time. This design minimizes waste and helps make my application process quick and efficient. For the quality and effectiveness of the product, I find Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion to be reasonably priced. A little goes a long way, and with regular use, a bottle lasts me quite some time. It‚Äôs a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to improve their skin‚Äôs moisture barrier. Overall, Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion is a standout product for anyone battling dry skin. Its effective moisturizing properties, skin-soothing ingredients, and user-friendly packaging make it a go-to in my daily skincare routine. Whether you're dealing with occasional dryness or persistent skin issues, I would highly recommend giving this lotion a try. It‚Äôs certainly earned a permanent spot on my bathroom shelf",,
Luca To,5,2024-10-16,"I bought this as I was looking for an oil-free moisturiser that would be hydrating enough for my skin (quite sensitive to dryness) while not being greasy and slippery during pole fitness. Even as a last minute panic purchase, the price was reasonable for the size. It was a bit hit-or-miss in terms of slip issues - on some days, it was AMAZING for grip in my pole classes, but I learned that you really shouldn't use it on a super hot and humid summer day. At least make sure you shower and use it at night for a midday class, or in the morning for an evening class. I'll be retrying it for pole classes in the winter as it is a bit richer than my current go-to. However, I quickly discovered that it also works amazingly as a non-scented hand cream! I had to buy a relative who struggles with excessive hand-washing a bottle of this because it is a convenient way to soothe your hands from the harshness of hard water. They have sensitive skin and this cream caused zero itchiness or irritation! It is also great if you do work with your hands as there is no perfume to it unlike most luxury-focused hand creams. So, once absorbed, you can continue without the worry of getting scents on things! I believe it's also more cost effective than a tube of aveeno hand cream + the pump makes it gentle to use for people with grip issues. This moisturiser is certainly one worth repurchasing :)",,
Aanchal Dh,5,2024-10-16,"Great moisturizer, with good ingredients. Has a nice texture, and a mild scent that isn‚Äôt overpowering. Absorbs quickly into the skin as well.",,

Yer L.,5,2024-10-16,"I have tried many other brands of lotion for dry, itchy skin and nothing beats Aveeno for me. It helps keep my skin moisturizer throughout the day and keeps my skin smelling great.",,
Troyeisha H.,5,2024-10-16,"Whenever I'm going to a doctor's office or to any place where people who might be sensitive to fragrances may be (like around cancer patients going through treatment), I seek to use products that are fragrance-free like this lotion. I also like the Aveeno lotion with Ylang-Ylang, but for now let's talk about the scent-free version. It glides on smoothly, and is softening, not sticky. For me, a good test of the balance of emolliency is whether you can ready snap your fingers and hear the sound after you're done putting on lotion. If you can't, the texture is too greasy, oily, or thick. With this lotion, the ""snap test"" works successfully. That allows my skin to feel moisturized while not clogged with too much product. The reason for taking off a star is that as it gets toward the end of the bottle it tends to become thickened to the point where it just wants to stick to itself, and not readily dispense from the bottle. I've tried the trick of loosening the lid with the pump, striking the bottle on the counter to force some consolidation of the contents to be able to get more to flow out. That sort-of works for a while. It seems to end up with several inches of lotion sticking to the container, instead of dispensing. I'm now storing the end of the last bottle upside down in hopes of being able to use more of the lotion before its time to move on to the new one. Overall, this performs like a good quality lotion at a reasonable price.",,

Nique Hi,5,2024-08-17,"**Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion for Dry Skin: A Comprehensive Review** Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion has garnered a solid reputation as a go-to solution for dry skin, and after using it, it‚Äôs easy to see why. This lotion is formulated with colloidal oatmeal, which is known for its soothing properties, making it an excellent choice for those with sensitive or irritated skin. **Texture and Absorption:** The lotion has a lightweight, non-greasy texture that absorbs quickly into the skin. It doesn't leave a sticky or oily residue, which is a common issue with many other moisturizing lotions. This makes it ideal for daily use, as it can be applied in the morning without worrying about it interfering with your clothing or making your skin feel heavy. **Moisturizing Power:** One of the standout features of Aveeno‚Äôs lotion is its long-lasting hydration. Even though the lotion is light, it provides deep moisture that keeps the skin feeling soft and supple throughout the day. It's particularly effective on rough areas like elbows, knees, and heels, which are prone to dryness. After consistent use, you'll likely notice an improvement in the overall texture and appearance of your skin. **Ingredients:** Aveeno's use of natural ingredients, especially colloidal oatmeal, is a big plus. Oatmeal is known for its ability to restore the skin's natural barrier and prevent water loss, making it a key ingredient for maintaining hydration. The lotion is also free from fragrances, which reduces the risk of irritation for those with sensitive skin. **Suitability for Dry Skin:** For those struggling with dry skin, Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion is a reliable option. It‚Äôs gentle enough for daily use and strong enough to combat even very dry patches. Users with eczema or other skin conditions may find it particularly soothing. **Packaging and Price:** The packaging is straightforward and functional, with a pump dispenser that makes it easy to use. In terms of cost, Aveeno offers good value for money. It‚Äôs more affordable than many high-end moisturizers but delivers comparable, if not superior, results. **Final Verdict:** Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion for Dry Skin is a highly effective, no-nonsense product that delivers on its promises. With its soothing ingredients, non-greasy formula, and long-lasting hydration, it‚Äôs a top choice for anyone dealing with dry skin. Whether you‚Äôre looking for daily moisture or something to soothe irritated skin, this lotion is worth trying.",,
Morgan R.,5,2024-08-16,"I‚Äôve been using the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion for Dry Skin for several weeks now, and I‚Äôm thoroughly impressed with the results. As someone who struggles with dry, flaky skin, especially during the colder months, finding a lotion that provides long-lasting hydration without feeling greasy has been a challenge. Aveeno, however, has delivered on its promise. The lotion is lightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth throughout the day. I love that it‚Äôs fragrance-free, as it doesn‚Äôt clash with any other scents I might be wearing, and it‚Äôs gentle enough for sensitive skin. The oatmeal formula seems to really soothe and nourish my skin, reducing any irritation or itchiness that typically comes with dryness. One of the standout features of this lotion is how long the moisture lasts. I apply it once in the morning, and my skin stays hydrated well into the evening, even on the driest parts of my body like my elbows and knees. The texture is perfect‚Äînot too thick, but not so thin that it feels like it evaporates quickly. Overall, the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion has become a staple in my skincare routine. It‚Äôs effective, affordable, and lives up to its claims. I highly recommend it to anyone dealing with dry skin or looking for a reliable everyday moisturizer. This review emphasizes the lotion‚Äôs effectiveness, texture, and lasting moisture, making it appealing to potential users with similar skin concerns.",,

This rich and creamy formula is designed to provide long-lasting hydration to dry, itchy, and rough skin, and it truly delivers. The lotion absorbs quickly and easily, leaving my skin feeling soft, smooth, and supple. The fragrance is subtle and pleasant, with a hint of oatmeal scent that's not overpowering. I love that it's non-greasy and doesn't leave any residue behind. The oatmeal extract in this lotion is a game-changer for me. It helps to soothe and calm my dry skin, reducing irritation and itchiness. Plus, it's gentle enough for everyday use, making it perfect for all skin types. One of the best things about this lotion is its affordability. It's priced reasonably and comes in a large 20 oz bottle that will last a while. I'm thoroughly impressed with Aveeno's Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion for dry skin. It's a must-have in my daily routine, providing long-lasting hydration and relief from dryness and itchiness.

Yunny Le,5,2024-04-27,"FINALLY, I'VE FOUND IT! This is the perfect, lightweight, non-greasy daily moisturizing lotion for my dry hands and sensitive skin! I have tried many, many different moisturizers over the years, as my husband can attest - our master bathroom closet was crammed with various bottles until a recent ""no-holds-barred, throw everything we don't use out"" clean-up effort. I've only been really happy with the Vaseline Creamy Petroleum Jelly Deep Moisture formula. I have extremely sensitive skin (I can't use products with lanolin or strong herbal ingredients, such as Aveda). Coupled with this is the fact that I live in the Northeast, and we have cold, dry, harsh winters that really do a number on my hands, causing them to get severely dry and cracked (sometimes to the point of bleeding). I've been using the Vaseline cream, but the heaviness of the formula makes it more suited for overnight use, as it has a tendency to feel slightly greasy for a time after applying - so my search for an alternative daytime lotion continued. On a whim, I picked up a small tube of the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion at a local store during the winter of 2015. Hallelujah - insert choir of angels rejoicing here! This lotion is lightweight, fragrance-free, and devoid of all the additives that can be so irritating to my sensitive and allergy-prone skin. It absorbs very quickly, but provides deep, lasting moisture for my dry skin; I only need to apply this once or twice daily, even with frequent hand washing. My skin is soft and supple, with no chapping or flaking - I've even used it as a night cream on occasion. I've been using it for months now - I keep a tube of this in my office at work and in my purse, as well as a large bottle at home. Hooray - my search is over!",,

Whether it's combating harsh winter weather or soothing sun-exposed skin in the summer, this lotion has become a staple in my skincare routine year-round. Furthermore, the packaging is practical and user-friendly, with a pump dispenser that ensures easy and mess-free application.

As a parent concerned about my baby's delicate skin, I'm always on the lookout for gentle and effective skincare products. This moisturizer certainly delivers on both fronts. One of the standout features of Aveeno Moisturizer is its gentle formula. It's hypoallergenic and free from harsh chemicals, making it suitable for even the most sensitive skin types. Upon application, the moisturizer absorbs quickly into my baby's skin without leaving any greasy residue behind. This is especially important during diaper changes when I need a product that won't leave my baby feeling sticky or uncomfortable. I've noticed a significant improvement in my baby's skin texture since using aveeno Moisturizer. Dry patches have become less noticeable, and overall, my baby's skin feels softer and more hydrated. Another aspect worth mentioning is the packaging. The pump dispenser is convenient and mess-free, allowing for easy application without any spills or waste. In terms of value, Aveeno Moisturizer is competitively priced compared to other baby skincare products on the market. A little goes a long way, so one bottle lasts a decent amount of time, making it a cost-effective choice for parents. Overall, I highly recommend Aveeno Moisturizer for Baby to parents looking for a gentle and effective skincare solution for their little ones. It's a product I trust to keep my baby's skin healthy.",,

Living in a climate with harsh winters, my skin used to suffer from dryness and irritation. However, since incorporating this lotion into my daily skincare routine, I‚Äôve noticed a significant improvement. The formula is lightweight yet deeply hydrating, which means my skin feels moisturized without any greasiness or residue. One of the things I love most about this lotion is its simplicity; it‚Äôs fragrance-free and packed with natural ingredients, including colloidal oatmeal, which soothes and protects my sensitive skin. It absorbs quickly, allowing me to apply it anytime, and the hydration lasts all day. The pump bottle is convenient, making application mess-free and easy. I appreciate that Aveeno is a brand committed to using high-quality, natural ingredients, making this lotion a staple in my skincare regime. I‚Äôve recommended it to all my friends and family, and now I‚Äôm recommending it to you.

The Daily lotions texture is well balanced, not too thick or thin. When applying it on the skin it glides and distributes easily. I find it absorbes fairly quickly and it does not leave any residue or uncomfortable feeling, just soft and moisturized skin. As advertised there is no fragrance to the lotion either which is perfect for those who are sensitive and for those of us that work in scent free workplace. I also have sensitive and allergic skin and the Daily lotion did not cause me any issues at all. I am very pleased with moisturization of the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion and have a new favourite to add to my list.

It helped with my dry skin and kept it hydrated during the winter months and kept my skin feeling nourished in the winter. After applying, it didn‚Äôt leave my skin feeling oily or still dry, but rather smooth because of the good absorption.

Even after showering, my skin still feels nourished and moisturized. This lotion has become an essential part of my daily skincare routine.

Tran V.,5,2023-10-11,"Before, I used Vaseline body lotion, but when it was cold, it wasn't moisturizing enough, so I switched to Aveeno body lotion to try. A huge 354ml bottle of body lotion at a cheap price, very good for moisturizing for up to 24 hours so I immediately bought it to try to see if it was good. And as a result, I love it so far, I will buy it again when I use it up. Even though the company claims to be odorless, I personally think this product still has a scent, everyone, the smell is light, natural (but I don't know what the smell is), once applied to the skin it goes away for a while. The milky texture and extract are similar to the texture of Vaseline lotion, so it's soft and fast, doesn't stick or clog pores. At night I turned on the air conditioner, but in the morning my skin was still moist, which was really surprising. In particular, after using Aveeno body lotion for a while, it does not cause ""long hair growth"" and gradually the skin becomes smoother, especially in the knee and elbow areas. Because this product has benign and gentle ingredients, I often apply it to my neck area. A big bottle like that can take about 6-7 months to run out, so this is a very good product.",,

This lotion has become a staple in my daily routine, and I have nothing but positive things to say about it. First and foremost, it lives up to its promise of providing long-lasting moisture. I have dry skin, especially in the winter months, and this lotion keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day. It's not greasy at all, which is a big plus for me. I can apply it in the morning and not worry about feeling sticky or uncomfortable. What sets Aveeno apart is its use of natural ingredients like oatmeal. It soothes and calms my skin, which is particularly helpful when I have minor irritations or redness. I appreciate that it's fragrance-free because I have sensitive skin, and I don't have to worry about any added chemicals or scents causing irritation. The packaging is convenient with a pump dispenser, making it easy to control the amount of product I use. It's also reasonably priced, considering the quality and the amount you get in a bottle.

Mai Tr,5,2023-08-08,"Aveeno is an American brand specializing in hair and skin care products, established in 1945. The founder of this brand focused on researching the benefits of dry cereals for skin and hair, because this is a rich source of nutrients and extremely benign, suitable for all skin types. Therefore and most of its products have the main ingredients of oatmeal and natural essential oils to effectively nourish, moisturize and protect the skin. Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion is the company's best-selling product because it deeply moisturizes but the skin is still smooth, not greasy, not sticky, especially in the hot and humid climate here. Besides, the natural oatmeal ingredient is extremely benign, which can be used on children's skin is also a plus point for mothers to choose this product in a variety of body lotions. Especially after using the product you will not find it greasy, hissing and especially making pores. This is the main cause of acne. Soothes sensitive, irritated, dry or flaky skin, especially eczema-prone skin.

Chuong P.,5,2023-05-05,"Just found this one last month; since going through six weeks of chemo as far back as 2014 I have had to battle ‚Äúsevere dry skin‚Äù especially on my hands; it was so bad I had to cover them with white cotton gloves when I would go out in public and it pained me terribly (feeling like and looking like my hands were going to fall off my wrists; that‚Äôs the best way I can describe it); I am *allergic to two of the most common ingredients in skin moisturizers: Aloe and Lanolin! The only thing I could use was non-petroleum jelly and Shea Butter and as much as those *did help .. they never completely healed my skin. I kept searching. I did have a dermatologist put me on a new ointment of some sort that came out in 2015 but I got only one tube free and it worked but when I went to order it again I couldn‚Äôt afford it (at $100 a tube)! And I‚Äôve not been able to find anything to work since; until NOW! This ‚ÄúAverno Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion‚Äù. There were several reasons I decided to give it a try: Mainly, it does *not include ‚ÄúAloe nor Lanolin‚Äù in its ingredients; it has only TEN ingredients in it, it‚Äôs ‚Äúfragrance free‚Äù and ‚ÄúDermatologist Recommended‚Äù AND has *Prebiotic oat in it.

Now, I must say this though too ... I found out about",,
