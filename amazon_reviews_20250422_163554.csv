f48d3d0d8c235d827e715c1cc5006ffc,,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 1 March 2025,"As someone who has tried multiple whey proteins over the years, Nutrition Premium Gold Whey in Chocolate Hazelnut has completely exceeded my expectations. From the high protein content to the incredible taste and digestibility, this product has everything I look for in a whey protein supplement.

Premium Quality & Clean Ingredients

What sets this protein apart from others is its Isolate Whey Protein Blend, ensuring maximum purity and fast absorption. The fact that it is Informed Choice UK Certified gives me peace of mind that I'm consuming a product free from harmful additives or banned substances.

Perfect for Recovery & Muscle Growth

With 25g of high-quality protein per serving, this protein helps me recover faster and build lean muscle more effectively. The 11g of EAAs is a huge plus, as it supports muscle recovery and reduces fatigue after intense workouts. I‚Äôve noticed that my recovery time has significantly improved, and I feel less soreness even after heavy lifting sessions.

Digestibility & Absorption

What makes this whey protein unique is the ProHydrolase Enzyme Technology. This helps break down protein more efficiently, ensuring my body absorbs it properly. Unlike other protein powders that sometimes cause bloating or digestive discomfort, this one digests easily without any stomach issues.

Flavor & Mixability ‚Äì Absolutely Delicious!

The Chocolate Hazelnut flavor is simply amazing! It‚Äôs smooth, rich, and doesn‚Äôt have that artificial or overly sweet taste that some other brands have. Whether I mix it with water, milk, or blend it into a smoothie, it tastes fantastic every time. The mixability is also spot on‚Äîno lumps, no grainy texture, just a perfectly blended shake.

Why I Recommend It

High protein content with fast absorption

Certified for purity & quality (Informed Choice UK Certified)

Tastes fantastic and mixes easily

Easy to digest with ProHydrolase enzyme blend

Great for muscle recovery and lean muscle growth

This protein powder has become a staple in my fitness journey, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the results. If you‚Äôre looking for a top-notch whey protein that delivers on both taste and performance, I highly recommend giving this a try.",True,2 people found this helpful

3b5b859d5b42dfeb7828c587f7e4ab7d,,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 27 September 2024,"I‚Äôve been into fitness for over a decade, and choosing the right protein powder has always been crucial for my workout routine. After using the Bigmuscles Nutrition Premium Gold Whey, I can confidently say it delivers in terms of both nutrition and taste.

Key Features:
Protein Quality: Each scoop of 30g provides 24g of protein, which is derived from whey concentrate and isolate. This is an ideal blend for muscle recovery and growth, especially post-workout. It digests easily, and I didn‚Äôt experience any bloating, which is common with lower-quality proteins.

Amino Acid Profile: The product claims a rich BCAA profile (5.5g) and Glutamine content, making it perfect for enhancing muscle repair and reducing fatigue after intense workouts.

Low in Carbs and Fats: With only 2g of carbs and 1g of fat per serving, it‚Äôs a great choice for those on a low-carb diet or aiming for lean muscle gain.

Taste and Mixability:
Taste: I‚Äôve tried several chocolate-flavored whey proteins, but the Double Rich Chocolate flavor is genuinely one of the best. It‚Äôs rich, smooth, and doesn‚Äôt have that artificial aftertaste that some brands leave behind. Whether mixed with water or milk, the flavor holds up well, making it an enjoyable drink.

Mixability: Mixes perfectly with water, milk, or almond milk, leaving no clumps. I used both a shaker and stirred it manually, and in both cases, it dissolved quickly. This is a big plus since no one likes those grainy bits in their protein shake.

Effectiveness and Results:
I‚Äôve been using this protein for the past 3 weeks, and I‚Äôve noticed faster recovery times after intense strength training sessions. It‚Äôs light on the stomach and perfect for a post-workout shake. Additionally, I‚Äôve used it in recipes like protein pancakes and smoothies, and it blends beautifully, adding that extra nutritional boost.

Packaging and Value for Money:
The 1Kg tub is perfect for someone who is new to the product or prefers buying smaller quantities to keep things fresh. The packaging is sturdy, and the seal ensures the powder stays fresh.

Affordability: Considering the quality of ingredients and the competitive pricing, it offers excellent value for money compared to other premium whey brands on the market.

Final Verdict:
If you‚Äôre serious about your fitness goals and are looking for a reliable whey protein that provides great taste, high-quality protein content, and excellent mixability, Bigmuscles Nutrition Premium Gold Whey is a solid choice. Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or a seasoned athlete, this product ticks all the boxes.",True,49 people found this helpful

So I don't recommend this product just because it's price is low rather than this go for MB unflavoured concentrate or isolate protein which is just a little expensive than this but gives good amount of protein in 1 scoop especially of you are a vegetarian who can't able to complete daily protein intake from food and have to depend on other sources .

Considering the results, if it's pure whey, irrespective of brand it will give you the results. It's a myth that results vary from brands to brands. Actually the quality varies from brand to brand which ultimately impacts results.

Misleading Nutritional Claims: The product claimed to have high protein content, but upon closer inspection, I found discrepancies. The actual protein content was significantly lower than advertised. As a consumer, I felt misled and frustrated.

Artificial Ingredients Galore: This protein powder seemed like a chemistry experiment. It contained artificial sweeteners, flavors, and thickeners. These additives not only affect taste but can also have potential health implications1.
Digestive Distress: After consuming this powder, I experienced bloating and discomfort. It turns out that it contained lactose (from milk-based protein), which didn‚Äôt sit well with my digestive system

Unpleasant Taste and Texture: The flavor was lackluster, and the texture was gritty. It felt like I was drinking a chalky concoction. No one wants to struggle through their protein shake!
Quality Control Issues: The lack of third-party testing and quality control raised concerns. I couldn‚Äôt be sure if the product met safety standards or contained any harmful substances.",True,221 people found this helpful

I usually don't write reviews. Good or bad, a product needs to be really good or really really bad for me to write one.
I have had few other proteins before. From muscleblaze, from ON, you name it. I wanted to switch and try something budget friendly. So i choose this one because it is 500 rupees less than the muscleblaze biozyme. And the reviews are so good it's shocking. But mistake is mine for trying to save on such an important daily product.

Taste - cheap chocolate. 4/10.
Results - not worth it. (got better result using muscleblaze whey energy which isn't even result based)
Affect on body- HORRIBLE! immediately after using this, my stomach started bloating up and I went through so much pain i couldn't even move. I taught it might be something else so i tested removing other products from my diet but nope. It was this shitty excuse of protien that was causing insane acidity and gas. I even tried mixing it with oats because i didn't want waste it (hard earned money manh!) but still didn't help(although it was little better).
Lesson learned - buy cheap and buy twice. Will never make such a horrible mistake and try to buy cheap supplements ever again.

And FYI, i have good metabolism and never had gastric problems prior to this. I just hope i recover and stable up soon enough. This was just a bad experience and I have half a mind to sue this company somehow....",True,44 people found this helpful

I wish I had access to a lab which could test it out for me.

No matter how much money you might save buying this protein, nothing is more expensive than time. Don't waste yours and don't buy this brand - I am sure they will be exposed in the market for their lies sooner or later.

You can test this company by their label, they have given Amino Acid Profile and when you will plus all these numbers it will exactly give you 100G

How is it possible out of 100g protein is 100g available

On thier label they said they are providing 73G pf protein out of 100 bit by adding amino acod score it is different.

I was taking this protein from more than 7 months are 0 result.

This company should be closed.

Rest your choice buyers you might feel that taste is so good so nice mixability but you can test your protein by taking this to a lab test else you will see no result.",True,20 people found this helpful

But after their recent upgrade, this has to be the worst protien powder ever. It doesn't not mix well with water, leaving so many protien clumps. The new protien tastes very bad, nothing like the previous beligum chocolate version. If you are planning to buy a protien, do not even consider this product. ITS THE WORST PROTIEN IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW. I am switching to Muscle Blaze as I am writing this review.",True,5 people found this helpful

On authenticity as it's having high level of maltodextrin and rather muscle gain it help gain weight. All I can suggest is please avoid using these types of brands for just sake of taking protein.These companies makes a hype in market just because of Low Price and good advertisement . Instead if you can't afford good protein go for natural diet and don't play with your body because good protein comes with good price.",True,0 people found this helpful

But never have I come across a protein that costs 1.5k that tastes so horrible. I feel like puking after every two sips. When I say pukingz trust me I am not exaggerating. You can't have this whey with water. You might have to mix it with milk or something. But then there no point in it as it will increase the calorie intake. Milk has lots of calories that you will be just drinking. Never ever going to buy from this brand.,True,2 people found this helpful
