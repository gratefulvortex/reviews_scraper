24ea5d866117c8f36852fe4fe7e0e14d,,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 3 December 2024,"NIVEA Soft Light Moisturizer stands out as a top-tier, all-purpose cream that caters to your face, hands, and body. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula enriched with Vitamin E and Jojoba Oil makes it an excellent choice for daily use, providing instant hydration without leaving a sticky residue.

Key Features:

1. Non-Greasy Formula:
One of the standout qualities is its ultra-light texture. Unlike many moisturizers that leave a heavy or oily finish, NIVEA Soft absorbs quickly, leaving the skin soft and refreshed.
2. Multi-Purpose Use:
The versatility of this cream is remarkable. It works equally well for your face, hands, and body, simplifying your skincare routine without compromising on quality.
3. Enriched with Skin-Loving Ingredients:
‚Ä¢ Vitamin E: Known for its antioxidant properties, it helps to protect the skin from environmental stressors and promotes a healthy glow.
‚Ä¢ Jojoba Oil: A deeply nourishing ingredient that mimics the skin‚Äôs natural oils, ensuring long-lasting moisture.
4. Instant Hydration:
From the moment you apply it, your skin feels instantly smoother and plumper. It‚Äôs a lifesaver for dry or rough patches, especially during harsh winters or after sun exposure.
5. Convenient Packaging:
The 300 ml tub is generously sized, making it perfect for families or long-term use. The packaging is sturdy, easy to use, and travel-friendly.

Performance:

I found this moisturizer to be highly effective, even for my combination skin. It didn‚Äôt clog pores or cause breakouts on my face, while also being hydrating enough for drier areas like elbows and knees. It provides an ideal balance between moisture and lightness, making it suitable for all skin types.

Pros:

‚Ä¢ Lightweight and non-greasy
‚Ä¢ Multi-purpose for face, hands, and body
‚Ä¢ Infused with Vitamin E and Jojoba Oil
‚Ä¢ Quick absorption
‚Ä¢ Affordable and widely available

Cons:

‚Ä¢ The fragrance, though mild and pleasant, might not appeal to those sensitive to scented products.
‚Ä¢ Tub packaging may not be ideal for those preferring pump or tube dispensers for hygiene.

Verdict:

NIVEA Soft Light Moisturizer is a reliable, budget-friendly option for anyone seeking a non-greasy, effective moisturizer for daily use. Its combination of quality ingredients, instant hydration, and versatile application makes it a staple in any skincare routine. Highly recommended for all seasons and skin types.

This non-greasy cream is perfect for daily use, as it provides instant hydration and leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft and smooth.

One of the things I love about this moisturizer is the inclusion of Vitamin E and Jojoba Oil, which are both fantastic for nourishing and protecting the skin. The scent is also pleasant and not overwhelming, which is a big plus for me.

Another great thing about this product is that it comes in a 300 ml bottle, which is a generous size and great value for the price. I use it all over my body, including my face and hands, and it works wonders in combating dryness and flakiness.

Overall, I highly recommend the Soft Light Moisturizer for anyone looking for a high-quality, versatile moisturizer that provides excellent hydration without leaving a greasy residue.

Having done that, I can say this does the job well. When applied correctly, it doesn't turn your skin oily and keeps your skin smooth and supple for the better part of the day. In fact, I also use it on my head as I shave my head and this cream keeps the skin soft, especially when used immediately after a bath.

Go for it if you need an all-purpose moisturising cream that has a light-to-mild effect only. If you have very dry skin, this might not be the one for you. Also, disregard the mint scent claim as it's just a gimmick.",True,2 people found this helpful

I have a extremely dry skin, I mean it is almost Thar desert for me. I use this all over my body, immediately after using the cream. It makes my skin look baby soft in texture.

Completely satisfied with this product. Nivea has been a oldie product for 90s kid, I have used many products when I was in school. Back then, we didn't had much options in India but now we have tons of Nivea product available in drugstore.

But, when I received it, something told me this product was off. The foil that covers the cream peeled off very easily like someone had opened it before and placed it back again. Then my suspicion was confirmed when I applied a little of the cream in my hand and it started to burn. I got my sister to test it and she felt the same burning sensation. Finally, we decided the best course of action was to throw it away. Very disappointed and annoyed about the whole thing.",True,99 people found this helpful

Edit: product quality is indeed best but the business tactics used by brand and seller are deceitful. First of all I received product with slightly opened seal. Also the package says it is 300ml but on comparing it with the 300ml container bought previously, there is a huge difference. The quantity received is equal to 200ml (size compared with nivea peach cream 200ml) but the description says orherwise. Customer care also did not provide any solution. I like nivea's products but this time it is huge disappointment. They are charging for 300ml for a 200ml cream.",True,0 people found this helpful
