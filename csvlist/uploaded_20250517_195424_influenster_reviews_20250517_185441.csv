Alejandro R.,5,2025-05-10,"i don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but i had to for these. i picked up a box of nike pd7 long golf balls kinda randomly‚Äîi was just looking for something affordable to mess around with during a weekend round. didn‚Äôt expect much. but after playing a full 18 with them, i‚Äôm officially a believer. first off, the distance is real. i don‚Äôt have a crazy fast swing speed, but these things were jumping off my driver. like 10‚Äì15 yards farther than the balls i usually play (i won‚Äôt name names, but they cost twice as much). they stayed low and piercing, even into a bit of wind, and i wasn‚Äôt losing balls left and right either because they flew surprisingly straight. on my iron shots, the control was decent‚Äînot tour-level spin or anything, but predictable, and that‚Äôs all i need. i even stuck a couple greens with my wedges and they didn‚Äôt roll out as far as i thought they would. for a ‚Äúdistance‚Äù ball, the feel around the green was way better than expected. soft enough to chip and putt with confidence. also, durability: i used the same ball for about 14 holes before i finally dunked it in the water on 15, and it still looked almost new before that. no scuffs or weird marks like you get with cheaper balls. honestly, i feel like these are slept on. for the price, the performance is insane. i‚Äôm stocking up before they disappear. if you‚Äôre a weekend golfer or just want a ball that gives you some extra yards without losing feel, the nike pd7 long is 100% worth trying.",,

Liam Fa,4,2023-09-03,"The Nike PD7 (Power Distance) Long golf ball for me is a must have wherever I can find it. It is the perfect combination of soft feel for beginners and distance. These balls are harder to get now because Nike has stopped pumping out golf equipment like they use to but you may still find it in major retailers, golf pro shops ect. My only problem was do too the soft feel and distance for a budget ball like this was the balls lack spin and short game feel around the greens, however for the price point I would not be worrying about that. Overall would definitely purchase again.",,
