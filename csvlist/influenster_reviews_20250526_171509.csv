-7771813202281049349,Marium K.,5,2016-04-26,"I have started using this product in winters, keeping in view seasonal requirements. I find it very nourishing for my hair. It made them healthy, silky and easy to manageable. It has one of the nicest cocoa butter smell and you will feel like eating it. It has no sulfate & parabens which are great. The only negative about this it can make your hair bit greasy which is totally justified because this product meant for this. I generally apply this in my ends and leave it for 2-3 minutes and then rinse off. Pros: * Nice smell * Sulfate & Paraben free * smoothns the texture of hair Cons: * Can make hair bit greasy Any Tips?: If you feel your hair are becoming more greasy/ heavy in texture, apply in a less quantity in your ends only Ideal For...: Dry to Damaged Hair.",,
