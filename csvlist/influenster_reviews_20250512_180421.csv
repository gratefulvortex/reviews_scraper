Alejandro R.,5,2025-05-10,"i don’t usually write reviews, but i had to for these. i picked up a box of nike pd7 long golf balls kinda randomly—i was just looking for something affordable to mess around with during a weekend round. didn’t expect much. but after playing a full 18 with them, i’m officially a believer. first off, the distance is real. i don’t have a crazy fast swing speed, but these things were jumping off my driver. like 10–15 yards farther than the balls i usually play (i won’t name names, but they cost twice as much). they stayed low and piercing, even into a bit of wind, and i wasn’t losing balls left and right either because they flew surprisingly straight. on my iron shots, the control was decent—not tour-level spin or anything, but predictable, and that’s all i need. i even stuck a couple greens with my wedges and they didn’t roll out as far as i thought they would. for a “distance” ball, the feel around the green was way better than expected. soft enough to chip and putt with confidence. also, durability: i used the same ball for about 14 holes before i finally dunked it in the water on 15, and it still looked almost new before that. no scuffs or weird marks like you get with cheaper balls. honestly, i feel like these are slept on. for the price, the performance is insane. i’m stocking up before they disappear. if you’re a weekend golfer or just want a ball that gives you some extra yards without losing feel, the nike pd7 long is 100% worth trying.",,
