Gel is quite thick, but after applying it gets absorbed to skin within seconds. Skin feels hydrated and smooth. It soothes sun burn and works really well for stretch marks and blemishes. Longevity of the product is okay. But I didn't like the added colour in it.",True,One person found this helpful

088358c0130c056b02309b3cad3a5f92,,3.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 5 October 2021,"I purchased the product for my skin and hair care...I applied the product on hair and skin and left it to dry for 10 minutes and washed it off with normal water....When applied on skin it was found to have a moisturising effect and I felt no irritation on skin....After application on hair it was smooth...But I felt disappointed as the product was not organic as it had a good content of perfume and colouring agents added to it... Ingredients of the product include rose water, wheat germ extract, green tea extract, honey, lemon peel extract, carbomer, pottasium hydroxide,sodium benzoate,benzyl alcohol and potassium sorbate...I personally felt that it would be better to use natural aloevera than the product if you have an option for getting aloevera...",True,2 people found this helpful
951f08cc3531b86c0c729eb9f183bd53,,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 20 November 2018,"Winters are here and so is the season of dry skin and chapped lips.

Moisturising your skin is most essential during winters to prevent ageing and uneven skin tones. It also keeps you fresh all day and increases your work capacity.

Oily creams and moisturisers may be unacceptable to some and may cause breakouts in some others. I have acne problem and so I remain very careful in what I apply on my skin.

While searching for a good skin care routine product, I came across this aloe gel formula from Indus Valley. I ordered it because the packaging was vintage ( I love vintagggeeee).

The biggest advantages about this product:
* easy to incorporate in your day to day skin care. If you have to apply the original aloe from the leaves, it will take some time to cut, wash, peel the leaves. It might not be the best idea for your busy schedule.
* It is not oily at all
* Made from natural product. Does not contain any chemicals or toxic substances
* Has a very nice aroma.

I am presenting to you some of the ways, I love to use aloe gel in my day to day routine. Hope you like it too.

Aloe gel has Vitamin E which acts as an antioxidant and a natural nutrient for your skin.

* Over the night moisturiser: Apply a teaspoonful of gel on your face and massage thoroughly. Leave it overnight to get a soft skin in the morning.
* Morning moisturiser: After washing your face, use aloe gel to soothe your skin and before going out. This protects the delicate skin from the harsh sunrays, pollution and dry air.
* Body lotion: You can use it to apply on your hands and legs in general as a good moisturiser.
* Hair mask: Mix it with a little amount of curd and prepare a paste. Apply it on your hair from roots to tips. Leave it for 1 hour and then wash it usually. This conditions and strengthens your hair. Alternately you can also apply the raw aloe gel to avail the same benefits. Do this once every 2 weeks.

So these are some of the ways, I like to use Aloe gel in my routine. If you guys have some novel ways, do let me know. I would love to try that.

And thats the end of it! Hope you enjoyed it! Send me feedback regarding what you would love to see on my blog next‚ù§Ô∏è

I tried it on the hair and it works but not as much as the real aloe Vera.
Affordable I guess compared to the competition
Very Light fragrance so it‚Äôs good and I like it (I don‚Äôt know if you would like it)
Fragrance fades of quickly after you apply
This is my 3rd bottle and it‚Äôs working fine",True,0 people found this helpful
