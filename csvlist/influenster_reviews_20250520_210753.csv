Lisa S.,5,2024-11-22,Palmers coconut body lotion is lovely. Feels luxurious when applying absorbing well. Leaves skin feeling very soft and smooth. Leaving a beautiful coconut scent on your soft skin!,,
Gintare T.,5,2024-10-18,"Daily body lotion that is moisturizing. I always use it after showering. It has a rather thick consistency, so you need to massage it well into the skin. The skin is left soft and supple and still smells like coconuts. Contains a coconut oil formula and green coffee extract. Therefore, the skin always looks radiant and healthy.",,
Ariel We,5,2024-09-21,I absolutely love this coconut lotion it smells so good. It absorbs in my skin nicely. The package is beautiful. I will definitely recommend this product.,,
Tasena Sa,5,2024-08-26,"This body lotion is lightweight, absorbing , moisturizing and most of all it smell amazing. I enjoy using this product it is good for every day use.",,
Mia C,4,2024-08-06,"This lotion is one i recommend to everybody, as it goes well with my vanilla perfume (as well as many others). It leaves you feeling moisturised all day, rubs in well and isn‚Äôt sticky. The coconut scent is beautiful and i get compliments all the time!! üíó While the packaging can collect dirt (as seen here) its easy to use and does the job well! x",,
Olha Z.,5,2024-06-30,"Palmers Coconut Bodylotion ü••üå¥ I'll start with the disadvantages, despite the fact that this is my favorite body lotion, the smell of this particular lotion is very cloying and pungent, I can‚Äôt use it at night because it‚Äôs very strong despite the smell, this is a super moisturizing lotion, the best in the business, absorbs quickly, has a nice soft texture, my special recommendation for those with dry skin the lotion has a good thick plastic packaging, with a convenient spout for receiving the product good clean composition",,
Kaylee Es,5,2024-04-07,I love this lotion so much that I had to buy the value size. I use this lotion everyday. I find the coconut smell super nice and not overpowering as well as a nice scent to pair with my perfume. The scent lasts the whole day on my skin and the hydration is my favorite part of this lotion. Also love that it isn‚Äôt sticky like some lotions and not so watery. Have and would recommend this lotion to anyone who‚Äôs looking for a good lotion for everyday use!!üíó,,
Luishia C.,5,2024-01-19,"To start of with the scent is amazing! The texture does not feel thick and horrid, it is light and the absorption to skin is amazing. My skin has been bad over the years but is completely different with this moisturiser/body lotion.",,
Antoinette W.,4,2023-11-04,"""Palmer's Coconut Body Lotion is a true tropical delight! The rich coconut scent is heavenly and makes you feel like you're on a beach vacation. The lotion is incredibly moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling soft and long-lasting. It's also great for soothing dry or sun-exposed skin. I love the non-greasy formula, and it's become a staple in my skincare routine. If you're a fan of coconut-scented products and need deep hydration, this lotion you have to try.‚Äù",,
Deisy L.,3,2023-06-07,"S√≠ te gusta el olor a coco este producto te puede gustar para mi gusto es muy fuerte el olor si dura en la piel pero es demaciado el olor que te llega a cansar de tanto que huele, es hidratante y no es tan pesada su f√≥rmula If you like the smell of coconut this product you may like for my taste it is very strong the smell if it lasts on the skin but it is too much the smell that makes you tired of so much that it smells, it is moisturizing and its formula is not so heavy",,
LaChelle S.,5,2023-05-14,This lotion is absolutely amazing. It really does hydrate the driest of skin without leaving it feeling greasy or heavy. It smells of a light coconut scent due to the coconut oil and has green coffee in it to help skin keep a youthful glow. It holds up to it‚Äôs promise to deeply moisturise and give a radiant glow all at a really inexpensive price! Love it!,,
Lindsay Ri,5,2023-04-19,"Love the smell and consistency. I bought the pump bottle in large size. Easy to apply, easy to dispense. My new favourite lotion.",,
Journey Ba,5,2022-07-27,By far my favorite lotion ever it‚Äôs the only one i‚Äôll use !! Smells amazing and it never makes my allergies act up due to so many perfumes in products. I love pairing it with their coconut oil ! Best lotion ever!,,

Holly B.,5,2022-03-30,"Love, love, LOVE this stuff! It‚Äôs the only brand of the lotion that I have to have in the house, although I do use others. Even when I was pregnant, I never got one single stretch mark when I used palmers coconut oil cream. It smells great, leaves my skin not greasy, absorbs well, and softens my skin immediately. I will always buy these![product:palmers-coconut-bodylotion] [product:palmers-coconut-oil-body-butter] Ôøº",,
Tanasha A.,5,2022-02-22,"My hands would go from dry to smooth within seconds and it smells amazing. Long-lasting effects on the skin, keeping it smooth & soft",,
JELLE M.,4,2022-02-19,"I started using this because of amazing results with the face moisturizer, which is a gel cream consistency. I was hoping for something similar with the body lotion but it‚Äôs a pretty thick, but not rich lotion that is hard to rub in. The fragrance is pleasant light coconut smell that doesn‚Äôt make you smell like suntan lotion. I wouldn‚Äôt have minded a stronger coconut scent but the lighter, fresher iteration makes it more versatile and it won‚Äôt offend sensitive noses.",,
Kellen H.,5,2022-02-19,I love this lotion! It doesn‚Äôt make you feel greasy and it smells so good! It keeps you moisturized all day and has all natural ingredients in it! It wasn‚Äôt costly and I will definitely be buying this again!,,

Charlotte Ho,5,2021-05-14,"Used originally for healing tattoo's but has become my favourite moisturiser now. Works so well on dry areas. is not heavy, sticky and melts into the skin quickly but leaves it feeling soft all day. Plus it has a gorgeous scent. A must try!",,
,5,2021-05-04,"Price: $5.20 Best body lotion ever. My skin is so sensitive and dry, but this let the skin smooth and soft for hours. The smell is so gentle and natural and it‚Äôs so affordable. Finally you don‚Äôt need to soak yourself in cream, just a little bit is enough. I love it!!!",,

Sheryl K.,5,2021-01-03,[product:palmers-coconut-bodylotion] I live every thing that is Palmers. I love the coconut ü•• smell. The lotion is greasy.

BHAVYA NARAYANA DA,5,2020-10-05,"If you love coconut scented products like me then you will love this body lotion and if you have super dry skin then you will love this product even more. This coconut oil body lotion saved my extreme dry skin during winter because it is super moisturising. This lotion has a thick texture that melts onto the skin smoothly without feeling uncomfortable, leaving a nice coconut scent on my skin. I use the lotion at night and my skin feels super smooth the next morning. Highly recommend for people with dry skin.",,

Gem C.,4,2020-09-11,"I have tried SO many creams and lotions, from budget friendly low end to department store high end.... And this is BY FAR my favorite!!! I usually don't even make it half way through a bottle and I have this one well on it's way to empty, and I just bought it two weeks ago. It smells amazing, but the highlight of this product is the long lasting moisture... It actually does what it's supposed to lol",,
Kayleigh A.,3,2020-09-01,"I love the smell of this product üòç it has that 'holiday' smell. In regards to the actual products use for moisturiser... i don't actually think it is great. Initially, my hands feel moisturised and very fresh while rubbing the lotion in, however, within minutes, my hands or legs etc, will smell so lovely, but my hands will actually feel rather dry. I love the other Palmers moisturisers, so it is a bit disappointing. Will continue to finish off the bottle, but I don't feel that is a palmerd product I would buy again, unlike some of the other moisturisers that Palmers have to offer. ‚ô°x‚ô°",,
Brooklyn Br,5,2020-07-12,"Palmers alone is perfect for the skin, but adding coconut oil is just beyond amazing so hydrating and lushious, honest my skin wouldnt be the same with out it",,
Louise Ma,5,2020-06-12,"Swapped from coco butter by Palmers to this coconut oil body lotion about a week ago and I am so in love! It absorbs so well and leaves your skin feeling soft and nourished all day long. Not at all greasy and it is an absolute bargin (I think it was on offer when I bought it but even at full price it's still a steal). It is my new favourite and I would highly recommend giving it ago. It also smells really good, not too sweat or strong but just right.",,
Chelsea K,5,2020-04-11,Smells incredible and it makes your skill #skin feel like silk. I‚Äôm obsessed! You can fine it even at Walmart!,,
Robyn Si,5,2020-03-10,"Affordable, quality moisturizer. It claims 24 hour moisture...no lotion lasts through hand washing but in general I feel like this lotion helps heal my dry skin. It‚Äôs my go to winter lotion.",,
Beth Li,5,2020-02-11,I love using coconut oil on my skin and this oil/lotion formula is my new favorite! It goes on so smooth without a greasy oily type feeling . My dry skin drinks it up! It has a nice mold scent to it and the price is the best part!,,
Jenn Mc,5,2020-02-04,This stuff Relieves try skin like nothing I have ever used it has a great coconut some recent non-greasy little bit goes a long way and for so inexpensive it is the best solution for dabs on dry itchy skin,,
